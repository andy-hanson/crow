Crow executables (e.g. `bin/crow` or `bin/crow-debug`) link to `libgccjit`. This uses a GPL license, and so the executables do too.

Source code in this repository is in the public domain. This excludes:

* `dyncall` and anything in `.gitignore`, which aren't really part of this repository.
* Anything in `site-src/font`. See the readme there for sources.

The website icon `crow.svg` is from https://openclipart.org/detail/252189/raven-silhouette, where it is public-domain.
