Source code in this repository is in the public domain. This excludes:

* `dyncall` and anything in `.gitignore`, which aren't really part of this repository.
* Anything in `site-src/font`. See the readme there for sources.

If you build with `JIT=1`, executables (e.g. `bin/crow` or `bin/crow-debug`) will link to `libgccjit`.
This uses a GPL license, and so those executables will too.

The website icon `crow.svg` is from https://openclipart.org/detail/252189/raven-silhouette, where it is public-domain.

The web site uses fonts:
* Alkatra from https://github.com/suman51284/Alkatra
* Hack from https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack
* Murecho from https://github.com/positype/Murecho-Project
