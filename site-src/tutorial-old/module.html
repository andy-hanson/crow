	<h2>imports</h2>
	<p>
		Every function, type, or spec belongs to a module <em>module</em>.
		<br />
		Every crow file is a module (and every module is a file).
	</p>
</section>

	<h4>global imports</h4>
	<p>
		<code>crow/io/print</code> imports a global module. Global modules are located where crow was installed.
		<br />
		If you installed crow in <code>/home/me/crow/bin/crow</code>,
		the <code>crow/io/print</code> module will be in
		<code>/home/me/crow/include/crow/io/print.crow</code>.
		<br />
		There's currently no way to install third-party libraries in a way that supports global import syntax.
		(This is a TODO.)
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h4>local imports</h4>
	<p>
		<code>./foo</code> imports a <em>local</em> module.
		<br />
		Local module paths work like Posix relative paths:
		The start with either <code>./</code> or a series of <code>../</code>,
		then use a series of directory names separated by <code>/</code>.
		<br />
		For example, if the module at <code>/home/me/ornithology/waterfowl.crow</code> imports from
		<code>../../birds/duck</code>, that module should be in <code>/home/me/birds/duck.crow</code>.
		<br />
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h4>named imports</h4>
	The usual import syntax is to just write the module's path alone on a line.
	<br />
	You can specify particular names to be imported by adding a <code>:</code> after the module's path,
	then names of imports separated by commas.
	<br />
	If there are many individual names to import, they can go in an indented block.
	<crow-runnable no-run>
		import
			# import all names from module 'x'
			x
			# import just 'a' and 'b'
			y: a, b
			# import many names
			z:
				a, b,
				c, d
	</crow-runnable>
</section>
<section>
	<h4>circular imports</h4>
	<p>
		Circular imports between modules are not allowed.
		<br />
		That means that if module A imports module B,
		B can't import A, or any module that imports A.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>privacy</h2>

	<p>
		By default, the declarations (functions, types, specs) in a module are public.
		That means that they can be imported by other modules.
	</p>

	<p>
		To make a declaration private to its module, put a <code>.</code> before its name.
		(The <code>.</code> is not needed when using it.)
		<br />
		The same syntax works on functions, types, and specs.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable no-run>
		f string()
			"a"

		-g string()
			"swordfish"
	</crow-runnable>
	<p>
		In the above example, other modules could import <code class="fun">f</code>
		but not <code class="fun">g</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's allowed to have a public function and private function with the same name;
		importers will only import the public definition.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h3>privacy in records</h3>

	<p>
		Mark a record field private by putting a <code>.</code> before its name. This makes the getter function private.
		<br />
		If it is mutable, put a <code>.</code> before the <code class="keyword">mut</code>
		keyword to make the setter private too.
		<br />
		You can also make the setter private but the getter public, as in <code>public-get .mut str</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		If a record has at least one private member, <code>new</code> will be private.
		<br />
		You can also make it public by writing <code>.new</code> on a line before the record's fields.
	</p>
