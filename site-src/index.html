		Crow is an upcoming programming language.
		It's currently in alpha state, meaning breaking changes are likely.
	</p>
	<p>Some interesting features:</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li>
			Crow programs can be <strong>run directly from source</strong>.
			<br />
			You can also build your program to a standalone executable.
			In either case, you don't need a build system.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can <strong>directly call C</strong> functions.
		</li>
		<li>
			Data is <strong>garbage collected</strong>. Don't worry about what's by-reference or by-value.
		</li>
		<li>
			Crow is <strong>statically typed</strong>. There's no subtyping or implicit conversion.
			There are no null references.
			Overload resolution is unambiguous.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>I/O is controlled.</strong>
			Normal functions can't do I/O except by invoking a lambda from a parameter.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can launch <strong>parallel tasks</strong> and get the result as a <code>future</code>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Mutability is controlled.</strong>
			The type system tracks whether a type allows access to mutable data.
			This ensures that mutable data is not shared across threads.
		<li>
			Syntax is <strong>expression-based</strong>.
			Function bodies are expressions with no <code class="keyword">return</code> needed.
			<br />
			Even <code class="keyword">if</code> and <code class="keyword">for</code> are expressions.
		</li>
		<li>
			Code is <strong>flat</strong>. Most declarations are not nested inside of anything.
		</li>
		<li>
			Expressions are type-checked with an <strong>expected type</strong>.
			The same syntax like <code class="keyword">(1, 2)</code>
			could be a list, tuple, vector, etc.
			This saves you from having to write <code>new Foo()</code>.
		</li>
		<li>
			There are <strong>discriminated unions</strong>, including option types.
		</li>
		<li>
			There are <strong>templates</strong>; these are type-checked abstractly, not at each instantiation.
		</li>
		<li>
			All crow code goes in <strong>modules</strong>. There are no global declarations.
		</li>
