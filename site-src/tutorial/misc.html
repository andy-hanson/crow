	<h2>The standard import</h2>
	<p>
		All Crow modules automatically import the file <code>include/crow/std.crow</code>
		from where you downloaded Crow.
		<br />
		You can turn this off by writing <code class="keyword">no-std</code> at the top of a file;
		though there's no real reason to do so.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		no-std
		import
			crow/col/list: list
			crow/future: future, new
			crow/log: info, log
			crow/number: nat, new
			crow/string: literal, string

		main nat^(_ string[])
			info log "Hello, world!"
