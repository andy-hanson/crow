		Crow supports <code class="keyword">enum</code> and <code class="keyword">flags</code> types
		mostly for compatibility with C, but you might find them useful in other contexts.
	</p>

	<h2>Enum types</h2>

	<p>
		An enum type is a type that has only a specified set of possible values.
		<br />
		It's like a <code class="keyword">union</code>, except that choices can't have any associated value.
		<br />
		This restriction brings with it easy conversion to/from a number or string.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			info log "{left.opposite}"
			()

		direction enum
			left
			right

		opposite direction(a direction)
			match a
			as left
				right
			as right
				left
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		<code class="keyword">match</code> expressions work the same for enums as they do for unions.
		<br />
		Also as with a union, declaring the enum generates functions <code class="fun">left</code>
		and <code class="fun">right</code> returning enum values.
		<br />
		The similarity makes it easy to change an enum to union (or vice versa) without breaking too much code.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Conversion</h2>
	<p>
		Enums automatically support conversion to <code class="struct">nat32</code>,
		<code class="struct">symbol</code>, or <code class="struct">string</code>.
		<br />
		You can also convert from a <code class="struct">symbol</code> or <code class="struct">string</code>,
		which returns an option of the enum.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			info log "{left::direction2.to::nat32}"
			info log "{left::direction2.to::direction4}"
			info log "{up::direction4.to::direction2? ?? right}"
			()

		direction2 enum
			left
			right

		direction4 enum
			down
			up
			left
			right

		to direction4(a direction2)
			a.to::symbol.to::(direction4?)!

		to direction2?(a direction4)
			a.to::symbol.to
	</crow-runnable>

	<h2>Custom integer representation</h2>
	<p>
		By default, enums are stored as a <code class="struct">nat32</code>,
		but you can make it a different size of <code class="struct">nat</code>,
		or even an <code class="struct">int</code>.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			info log "{left.to::nat8}"
			()

		direction enum(nat8)
			left
			right
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		The generated <code class="fun">to</code> function's return type is the specified representation type.
	</aside>

	<p>
		You can also choose what integer values are associated with each value.
		(The default is 0, 1, 2, ... like in C.)
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			info log "{left.to::int16}"
			()

		direction enum(int16)
			left = -10
			right = 10
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside>
		<h4>Differences with C</h4>
		<p>
			In C, "enums" don't really declare types; they just declare names of integers.
			A variable in C declared with an enum type might have any integer value,
			including those not declared in the enum.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Crow, the declared enum values are the only valid values.
			If that doesn't match how a C enum is used, declare it as <code class="keyword">flags</code> instead.
		</p>
	</aside>

<section>
	<h2>Flags types</h2>

	<p>
		While enum types store <em>one</em> of the choices, flags types store any number of the choices.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			naked clothing = ()
			info log "{naked}"
			fully-dressed clothing = shirt | pants | shoes
			info log "{fully-dressed}"
			info log "{fully-dressed.to::json}"
			info log "{naked.can-serve}"
			info log "{shirt.can-serve}"
			info log "{fully-dressed.can-serve}"
			()

		clothing flags
			shirt
			pants
			shoes

		can-serve bool(a clothing)
			(shirt | shoes) is-in a
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		This calls <code class="fun">is-in</code> from {{doc/flags-util}}.
	</aside>

	<p>
		Declaring a <code class="keyword">flags</code> type declares a function <code class="fun">|</code>
		that gets the union of flags and <code class="fun">&</code> that gets the intersection.
	</p>

	<p>
		As with enums, you can specify the backing type and exactly what value each flag has.
		<br />
		Make sure they are powers of 2.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			info log (shirt | shoes).to::nat16.to-binary
			()

		clothing flags(nat16)
			shirt = 0b00100
			pants = 0b01000
			shoes = 0b10000
	</crow-runnable>
