	<h2><code class="keyword">extern</code> modifiers</h2>

	<p>
		In the previous two sections ({{tutorial/low-level}} and {{tutorial/js}}),
		we saw examples of code that can only run in a certain context.
		<br />
		<code>native extern</code> code can't be used when compiling to JavaScript;
		<code>js extern</code> code can only be used when compiling to JavaScript.
	</p>
	<p>
		The other builtin <code>extern</code>s are <code>posix</code>, <code>linux</code>, and <code>windows</code>,
		which mark functions that can only be used in the named operating system family.
	</p>
	<p>
		External libraries work similarly.
		For example, <code>sqlite3 extern</code> code can only be used when the library is available.
		<br />
		You won't be able to use a library name in <code>extern</code>
		unless it's configured in <code>crow-config.json</code>; that will be explained in {{tutorial/config}}.
	</p>
	<p>
		A normal function that doesn't any have an <code class="keyword">extern</code> modifier is universal;
		it can be used in any environment.
	</p>

	<h3>Posix-only example</h3>
	<p>
		This example won't work in the browser, so you have to download and <code>crow time-posix.crow</code>.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable name="time-posix.crow" no-run>
		import
			crow/io/duration: second
			crow/io/time: delay
			crow/c-types: err-t, long

		main void() summon, (native, posix) extern
			info log "It is now {get-unix-time}"
			1.second delay
			info log "It is now {get-unix-time}"

		get-unix-time nat() summon, trusted, (native, posix) extern
			time mut timespec = 0, 0
			err = CLOCK_REALTIME clock_gettime &time
			assert err == 0 : "Error getting time" error
			time.tv_sec to

		clock_gettime err-t(clock-id clockid, timespec timespec mut*) posix extern
		timespec record(tv_sec long, tv_nsec long) extern
		clockid enum extern
			CLOCK_REALTIME = 0
			# etc...
	</crow-runnable>
	<aside class="small">
		<code>(native, posix) extern</code> means that the function requires <em>both</em>
		<code>native</code> and <code>posix</code>.
	</aside>

	<p>
		Since <code class="function">clock_gettime</code> has no body but it does have an
		<code class="keyword">extern</code> modifier, it comes from an external library.
		<br />
		External functions default to <code class="keyword">bare</code>, <code class="keyword">unsafe</code>,
		and <code class="keyword">summon</code>.
		<br />
		Add <code class="keyword">trusted</code> to negate <code class="keyword">unsafe</code> and
		<code class="keyword">pure</code> to negate <code class="keyword">summon</code> if appropriate.
		<br />
		In this case neither is appropriate; the function has an obvious side effect (reading the time),
		and it's <code class="keyword">unsafe</code> because the caller must be careful to pass a valid pointer.
	</p>

	<aside>
		<h4>Trusting an extern function</h4>
		<p>
			Mark a function <code class="keyword">pure</code> if it depends only its arguments' values.
			<br />
			Leave it <code class="keyword">summon</code> if the function interacts with the external world.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mark a function <code class="keyword">trusted</code> if it works with all possible inputs.
			<br />
			Leave it <code class="keyword">unsafe</code> if some possible combination of parameters
			can cause bad behavior (such as a segmentation fault).
		</p>
		<p>
			The defaults are usually right;
			most C library functions are both <code>summon</code> and <code>unsafe</code>.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<p>
		Extern functions are meant for native libraries.
		<br />
		To call a JavaScript function, call a <code>js-global</code>,
		as in <code>"alert".js-global call "hello"::string</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Just like with <code class="keyword">summon</code>,
		the caller of a function with <code class="keyword">extern</code>s
		must specify the same <code class="keyword">extern</code>s (or a superset).
		<br />
		So, <code class="function">main</code> must declare <code>(native, posix) extern</code>
		because it calls <code class="function">get-unix-time</code>.
		<br />
		Also like with <code class="keyword">summon</code>,
		you can create a lambda inside a function with <code class="keyword">extern</code>s,
		and pass it to functions without any <code class="keyword">extern</code> to make it available there.
	</p>

	<h2>Extern types</h2>

	<p>
		Notice the <code class="keyword">extern</code> modifiers on the <code class="keyword">record</code> and
		<code class="keyword">enum</code> declarations above.
		Any type referred to by an <code class="keyword">extern</code> function
		needs to be marked <code class="keyword">extern</code>. (The library name doesn't need to be on the type.)
		<br />
		This forces Crow to use a C-compatible type layout.
		<br />
		A <code class="keyword">record</code> that is <code class="keyword">extern</code> is always
		<code class="keyword">by-val</code>, like a C <code class="keyword">struct</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Primitive types like <code class="type">nat</code> that have C equivalents
		are all <code class="keyword">extern</code>.
		<br />
		Crow-specific types like <code class="type">string</code> are not.
	</p>
	<aside class="danger">
		<h4>C equivalent types</h4>
		<p>
			In Crow, <code class="type">int</code> always means <code class="type">int64</code> on all systems.
			<br />
			This is not guaranteed in C, so when translating C headers,
			use an alias from {{doc/c-types}} like <code class="type">c-int</code>.
		</p>
	</aside>
</section>

	<h2>Supporting multiple platforms</h2>

	<p>
		Crow doesn't have any kind of conditional compilation; all code is type-checked the same on all platforms.
		<br />
		That means code that has no compile errors on your machine will have no compile errors anywhere else.
		<br />
		However, sometimes you want different behavior on different platforms.
	</p>

	<p>
		What if we want a <code class="function">get-unix-time</code> function that works on all platforms
		(like the one in <code class="module">crow/io/time</code> does)?
		<br />
		For that, there is a special kind of expression <code>extern foo</code>.
		<br />
		This has a <code class="type">bool</code> value and will be true
		if the external capability <code>foo</code> is available.
		<br />
		If the condition of an <code class="keyword">if</code> expression is an <code class="keyword">extern</code>
		expression, the <code>true</code> branch of the <code class="keyword">if</code>
		will have those externs in scope.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable name="time-xplat.crow" run-js>
		import
			crow/io/duration: second
			crow/io/time: delay
			crow/js: js-global, call-new, call-property, cast
			crow/c-types: err-t, long

		main void() summon
			info log "It is now {get-unix-time}"
			1.second delay
			info log "It is now {get-unix-time}"

		get-unix-time nat() summon, trusted
			if extern native && extern posix
				time mut timespec = 0, 0
				err = CLOCK_REALTIME clock_gettime &time
				assert err == 0 : "Error getting time" error
				time.tv_sec to
			elif extern js
				msec float = "Date".js-global.call-new call-property "valueOf" cast
				msec / 1000 to
			else
				throw not-implemented

		clock_gettime err-t(clock-id clockid, timespec timespec mut*) posix extern
		timespec record(tv_sec long, tv_nsec long) extern
		clockid enum extern
			CLOCK_REALTIME = 0
			# etc...
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside>
		<h4>Observing the platform</h4>
		<p>
			Using an <code>extern</code> expression is unsafe, since it lets you change behavior based on platform.
			Usually, you should mark the function using it as <code class="keyword">summon</code>,
			because it accesses information (the current platform) not passed into the function through a parameter.
			<br />
			In some rare cases, a function that uses <code class="keyword">extern</code> conditions
			does not have to be marked <code class="keyword">summon</code> if it has identical behavior
			on all platforms regardless of implementation details.
			<br />
			For example, <code>subscript</code> on an array has a different implementation for
			<code>extern native</code> vs <code>extern js</code>, but the behavior is the same.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<p>
		Running this in the browser will use the <code>extern js</code> branch,
		while downloading and using <code>crow time-xplat.crow</code>
		will use the <code>extern native && extern posix</code> branch.
	</p>

	<p>
		Above, the body of <code>if extern native && extern posix</code> can assume
		<code>native</code> and <code>posix</code> externs are available;
		the body of <code>elif extern js</code> can assume <code>js</code> is available;
		and the <code>else</code> branch can assume nothing.
	</p>

	<h2>Extern type declarations</h2>
	<p>
		In some external libraries, there are types that are completely opaque, and only dealt with through pointers.
		For those, you can declare the type as simply: <code>foo extern</code>.
		You can't create such a type by value, but you can declare a <code>foo*</code> or <code>foo mut*</code>.
	<p>
		Sometimes you do need to create the type by value, but still don't need to know any of the details.
		<br />
		In that case, declare it with a size (in bytes): <code>foo extern(64)</code>.
		You can also specify alignment: <code>foo extern(64, 1)</code>.
		Otherwise alignment is the largest power of 2, up to 8, that the size is divisible by.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Types that vary by platform</h2>

	<p>
		If the contents of a type needs to be different depending on the platform,
		use a <code>union</code> of the possibilities.
		<br />
		Then to use the type, use <code>if extern</code> and force the appropriate member of the union.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Using external libraries</h2>
	<p>
		To actually use an external library,
		it will need to be enabled in <code>crow-config.json</code>; see the next section.
