	<h2>declaring specs</h2>

	<p>
		A template is type-checked <em>abstractly</em>,
		meaning it is type-checked before its type arguments are available.
		<br />
		That means that if a template calls <code>a + b</code>,
		and the type of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have a type parameter,
		the code won't compile because <code class="fun">+</code> doesn't work on all types.
		<br />
		That's where <code class="keyword">spec</code> comes in.
		<br />
		A <code class="keyword">spec</code> is a declaration that certain functions will exist,
		even if those functions aren't available yet in the code that uses the <code class="keyword">spec</code>.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable src="spec"></crow-runnable>

	<p>
		In this example, <code class="fun">sum</code> wants to call <code class="fun">+</code>.
		<br />
		To accomplish that, it declares <code>add&lt;a></code>.
		<br />
		<code>add</code> is a <code class="keyword">spec</code> that declares functions
		that the compiler can assume will exist when <code>sum</code> is called.
	</p>
	<p>
		When code calls <code class="fun">sum</code>, the compiler will look for definitions of
		<code class="fun">new</code> and <code class="fun">+</code> in the scope of the caller.
		<br />
		"Scope" here means the module's functions and its imports; local variables aren't considered.
		<br />
		Calling <code class="fun">sum</code> generates a concrete function
		that refers to functions from the caller's scope.
		<br />
		(That means that different callers of <code>sum@&lt;nat></code> might be calling different concrete functions
		if one caller had a different <code>+</code> function in scope.)

	<h2>special specs</h2>

	A user-defined spec declares functions, but some builtin specs do other things.

	<h3>type specs</h3>
	<p>A few special specs are properties of a type itself.</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li>
			<code class="spec">is-data&lt;a></code> is a spec that is only satisfied if
			<code>a</code> is an immutable type.
			<br />
			This is used for dictionary keys, since changing a key would corrupt the dictionary.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code class="spec">is-sendable</code> is like <code class="spec">is-data</code>
			but supports <code class="struct">fut</code> and <code class="keyword">ref</code> types.
			A type must be sendable to be used in the closure of a <code class="fun">launch</code>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>summon</h3>
	<p>
		A function marked <code class="keyword">summon</code> can perform I/O directly instead of through a callback.
		<br />
		It can "summon" the ability to do I/O out of nowhere.
		<br />
		Only <code class="keyword">summon</code> functions can call <code class="keyword">summon</code> functions.
	</p>

	<h3>unsafe / trusted</h3>
	<p>
		A <code class="keyword">unsafe</code> function can do unsafe things like work with pointers.
		<br />
		Only <code class="keyword">unsafe</code> and <code class="keyword">trusted</code> functions
		can call <code class="keyword">unsafe</code> functions.
		<br />
		<code class="keyword">trusted</code> places no requirements on the caller.
	</p>
	<p>
		It should not be possible to write safe code that corrupts memory;
		a function should be marked <code class="keyword">trusted</code> only if it checks its inputs.
		<br />
		for example, <code>xs[i]</code> throws an exception if <code>i</code> is out of bounds,
		so the unsafe pointer dereference it uses internally can't fail.
		<br />
		(It could fail if the array was corrupted somehow, but that is the fault of whatever code did that.)
