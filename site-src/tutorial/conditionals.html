	<h2>"If" expressions</h2>

	<h3>"If" syntax</h3>

	The syntax for an <code class="keyword">if</code> expression is simple:
	just put the true and false branches in indented blocks.

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			if 2 &lt; 3
				info log "True branch"
			else
				info log "False branch"
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		There is no "truthiness" in crow; the type of the condition must be <code class="type">bool</code> exactly.
	</aside>

	<h3>Using "if" as an expression</h3>
	<p>
		Crow's syntax technically does not have any statements; only expressions.
		Any line of code not at the end of a block is a <code class="type">void</code> expression.
	</p>
	<p>
		When an <code class="keyword">if</code> appears in a <code class="type">void</code> context,
		the true and false branches must also be <code class="type">void</code> expressions.
		<br />
		A call to <code class="function">log</code> works because
		it is a function returning <code class="type">void</code>.
	</p>

	<aside>
		<h4>The "void" type</h4>
		<p>
			<code class="type">void</code> is a type and works anywhere a type does.
			<br />
			It has no content and takes up no space.
		</p>
		<p>
			<code class="keyword">()</code> can construct an empty value of most types.
			(More on this in {{tutorial/special-call-syntax}}.)
		</p>
	</aside>

	<p>
		Since <code class="keyword">if</code> is an expression,
		it can have a non-void type like <code class="type">string</code>.
		So the first example can be rewritten as:
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log if 2 &lt; 3
				"True branch"
			else
				"False branch"
	</crow-runnable>

	<h3>"Elif"</h3>
	<p>
		You can add additional conditions to the chain using <code class="keyword">elif</code>.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log if 3 &lt; 2
				"First condition is true (second condition not checked)"
			elif 2 &lt; 3
				"First condition was false, second condition is true"
			else
				"Neither condition is true"
	</crow-runnable>

	<h3>"If" without "else"</h3>
	<p>
		If no <code class="keyword">else</code> branch is written, it will default to <code class="keyword">()</code>.
		This can create an empty value of most types; for example, it can be an empty string.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log "for 2: '{2 f}'"
			info log "for 4: '{4 f}'"

		f string(a nat)
			if a &lt; 3
				"True branch"
	</crow-runnable>

	<h3>"Unless" expressions</h3>
	<p>
		<code class="keyword">unless</code> works the same as <code class="keyword">if</code>
		except the condition is negated.
		This doesn't support an <code class="keyword">else</code> branch, since the double negation would be confusing.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			unless 2 &lt; 3
				info log "This won't log, because 2 &lt; 3"
	</crow-runnable>

	<h3>Ternary expressions</h3>

	<p>There is an alternative syntax for short <code class="keyword">if</code> expressions.</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			x = true ? "crow" : "duck"
			info log "x is '{x}'"
			# The false branch is still optional
			y = false ? "crow"
			info log "y is '{y}'"
	</crow-runnable>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Scope</h2>

	<p>
		Each indented block of code has its own scope.
		Variables declared within the block can't be used outside of it.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			result = if 2 < 3
				x = 1
				x
			info log "{result}"
			# This won't work:
			# info log "{x}"
	</crow-runnable>

	<h3>"Do" expressions</h3>
	<p>
		<code class="keyword">do</code> is an <em>unconditional</em> expression.
		It's useful for introducing an indented block for scoping or nicer syntax.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log do
				x = "world"
				"hello, {x}"
	</crow-runnable>
