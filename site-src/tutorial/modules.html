	<h2>Imports</h2>

	<p>
		Every <code>.crow</code> file is its own module.
		All of the declarations in that file are in the scope of the module.
		<br />
		For another module to see a declaration, it must import it.
	</p>

	<h3>Named imports</h3>
	<crow-runnable no-run name="greetings.crow">
		# greetings.crow
		hello string()
			"hello, world"
	</crow-runnable>
	<br />
	<crow-runnable>
		import
			./greetings: hello

		main void()
			info log hello
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		Don't pass multiple files to <code>crow run</code>.
		<br />
		Just pass the file containing <code class="function">main</code>,
		and Crow will use import paths to find other files.
	</aside>

	<h3>Whole-module imports</h3>
	<p>
		You can also omit the list of particular names to import to import all names from the module.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		import
			./greetings

		main void()
			info log hello
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		Operators like <code>==</code> are just functions and need to be imported too.
		If it's annoying to write them all out, just import the whole module.
	</aside>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Module import paths</h2>

	<h3>Relative imports</h3>
	<p>
		For importing your own code, the import syntax is designed to look like Unix-style relative paths
		(minus the <code>.crow</code> extension).
		<br />
		E.g., to import from <code>../foo/bar.crow</code>, you would write <code>../foo/bar</code>.
	</p>
	<aside class="small">Always use <code>/</code> instead of <code>\</code>, even on Windows.</aside>

	<h3>Library imports</h3>
	<p>
		An import like <code>crow/io/print</code> that starts with a plain name
		(as opposed to <code>./</code> or <code>../</code>) is a library import.
		<br />
		The first part of the path is the library name.
		In <code>crow/io/print</code>, the library name is <code>crow</code>.
		<br />
		A global import first looks up the library path, then appends the rest of the path to that.
		<br />
		If the library name is <code>crow</code> or <code>system</code>,
		the library path is <code>include/crow</code> or <code>include/system</code>
		from where Crow is installed.
		<br />
		Otherwise, the library path must be specified in <code>crow-config.json</code>. (See {{doc/config}}.)
	</p>
	<aside class="small">
		<code>crow/std</code> is imported by default.
		This re-exports common modules like <code>crow/string</code> so you don't have to explicitly import them.
		<br />
		See them all <a href="https://github.com/andy-hanson/crow/blob/master/include/crow/std.crow">here</a>.
	</aside>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>File imports</h2>

	<p>
		Another interesting import in <code>demo/sdl/main.crow</code> is <code>./crow.bmp as crow-bmp nat8 array</code>.
		<br />
		This creates a constant <code>crow-bmp</code> of type <code>nat8 array</code>,
		containing the contents of the file.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		import
			./hello.txt as hello string

		main void()
			info log hello
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		An advantage of having the file contents available as a constant without having to read the file at runtime
		is that it can be used in functions that aren't <code>summon</code>.
	</p>

	<aside class="small">
		Currently, the only supported file import types are <code>nat8 array</code> and <code>string</code>.
	</aside>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Modules are linear</h2>

	<p>
		Dependencies can only work in one direction.
		Two modules can't import each other; only one may depend on the other.
		<br />
		If you have two modules that you need to depend on each other, the solution is usually to declare
		types in a common module that can be imported by both.
		<br />
		Specs, explained in {{tutorial/specs}}, can also help by replacing direct function dependencies.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Visibility</h2>

	<p>
		"Visibility" controls whether declarations (functions, types, etc.) can be imported.
		<br />
		If you don't care for this kind of feature and you aren't writing a library,
		you can ignore this section; the default visibility doesn't restrict anything within your own code.
	</p>

	<p>
		The three kinds of visibility a declaration are:
	</p>
	<table class="operators">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Symbol</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td><code>+</code></td>
				<td>Public visibility; any module can import it.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>~</code></td>
				<td>Internal visibility; it can be imported by a relative import but not by a library import.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>-</code></td>
				<td>Private visibility; it can't be imported. It's only visible within its module.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>
		By default, declarations (like functions, types, etc.) have internal visibility.
		<br />
		This is the default because it prevents accidentally adding public functions,
		but doesn't add friction to calling functions you wrote.
		<br />
		If you aren't writing a library, you could choose to never specify visibility,
		and everything will be accessible within your code.
	</p>
	<p>
		To make a declaration public, put a <code>+</code> in front of it.
		<br />
		To make it private, put a <code>+</code> in front of it.
		<br />
		Although it is the default, it can be made explicitly internal with a <code>~</code> in front of the name.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable no-run name="dimensions.crow">
		# dimensions.crow
		+dimensions record
			-width float
			-height float

		~new dimensions(side float)
			side, side

		+area float(a dimensions)
			a.width * a.height

		-debug string(a dimensions)
			"{a.width}, {a.height}"
	</crow-runnable>
	<br />
	<crow-runnable>
		import
			./dimensions

		main void()
			a dimensions = 4,
			info log "{a.area}"
			info log a.debug
			# above has a compile error, will throw
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		The short record syntax doesn't support field visibility.
		In order to use declare visibility for record fields, you need to write them as an indented block.
	</aside>

	<p>
		In this example, you can't call <code class="function">width</code>, <code class="function">height</code>,
		or <code class="function">debug</code> from outside <code>dimensions.crow</code>.
		<br />
		You also can't call the default <code class="function">new</code> function for
		<code class="type">dimensions</code> that takes arguments for <code class="function">width</code>
		and <code class="function">height</code>, since those are private.
		<br />
		You <em>can</em> call the other <code>new</code> function which is declared internal.
		(Functions with the same name don't have to have the same visibility.)
	</p>
	<p>
		A record itself can be public while its fields are private. This allows you to define abstract data types.
	</p>

	<aside>
		<h4>Unused code</h4>
		<p>
			If you comment out <code>info log a.debug</code> to fix the compile error,
			you'll see a warning that <code class="function">debug</code> is unused,
			since it isn't used in <code>dimensions.crow</code> and can't be used anywhere else.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<aside>
		<h4>Visibility for operators</h4>
		<p>
			When defining a function named <code class="function">-</code>, , <code class="function">~</code>,
			or <code class="function">+</code>, it must have an explicit visibility,
			as in <code>+ + nat(a nat, b nat)</code>.
			<br />
			The first <code>+</code> is the visibility, and the second is the function name.
		</p>
