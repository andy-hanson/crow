		All ordinary Crow code runs in a <em>fiber</em>.
		<br />
		A fiber is like a thread, but implemented by the Crow runtime instead of the operating system.
		The term <em>thread</em> always refers to a native thread.
		<br />
		The <code class="type">fiber</code> type is internal to the Crow runtime; you only deal with it indirectly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fibers let you:
		<ul class="bullets">
			<li>Do "blocking" operations, such as network requests, without using callbacks.</li>
			<li>Write separate code for procedures which at runtime will actually run interleaved.</li>
			<li>Run code in parallel to get work done in less time (by using more processor cores).</li>
		</ul>
		Threads accomplish all of these too, but fibers use less resources (so you can have more of them),
		and have features to make parallel code safer.
	</p>
	<p>
		A fiber is a <em>logical</em> series of operations that don't necessarily
		correspond to sequential machine instructions.
		<br />
		A fiber might delay for a while, or wait for an event like a keypress.
		<br />
		For example, <code>3.second delay</code> does not literally freeze the thread for 3 seconds;
		the thread does other work while the fiber is set aside for 3 seconds.
		<br />
		When a fiber is delayed for whatever reason, it is said to <em>yield</em>.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>The fiber queue</h2>
	<p>
		The runtime maintains a queue of runnable fibers, called the <em>fiber queue</em>.
		<br />
		This contains immediately runnable fibers only; fibers that are blocked are handled in various ways.
		(So, the only reason for the queue to remain non-empty
		is if there are more runnable fibers than available threads.)
		<br />
		The core runtime loop for each thread is to take a fiber off the queue, run it until it <em>yields</em>,
		do some bookkeeping, then repeat.
		<br />
		When the Crow runtime starts, it launches a thread for each processor,
		and creates the first fiber that will run <code class="function">main</code>.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Launching new fibers</h2>
	<p>
		The common way to launch a new fiber is to use <code>with : parallel</code>.
		This returns a <code class="type">future</code> for its result.
		<br />
		A <code class="type">future</code> represents a value that may not be ready yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code class="function">await</code> is a function that yields the current fiber
		(in this case, the one running <code class="function">main</code>)
		and adds it to a waiting list for the future.
		<br />
		(<code class="function">await</code> does not <em>cause</em> the other fiber to run;
		that was already started by <code>with : parallel</code>. It just observes the result.)
		<br />
		When the future is resolved (in this case, when the code inside <code>with : parallel</code> completes),
		the awaiting fiber is added to the fibers queue, meaning it will resume as soon as a thread is available.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			fut nat future = with : parallel
				info log "Computing value"
				7
			info log "Waiting for value..."
			info log "{fut await}"
	</crow-runnable>
	<aside>
		<h4>The browser is not parallel</h4>
		<p>
			If you run this from the command line, it might log "Computing value" before "Waiting for value...".
			<br />
			In the browser, there's only one thread, so the "parallel" fiber can't start running
			until the main fiber yields at the <code class="function">await</code>.
		</p>
	</aside>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>More parallel fibers</h2>
	<p>
		{{doc/parallel}} has more useful functions for running code in parallel.
		For example, it includes a parallel <code class="keyword">for</code> loop.
		This creates a fiber for each element of a collection.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			squares nat[] = for x : 1::nat .. 10 parallel
				x * x
			info log "{squares.to::json}"
	</crow-runnable>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Exclusion</h2>
	<p>
		A fiber can't share mutable state with other fibers running in parallel. This is the thread-safety problem.
		<br />
		So, <code class="keyword">with : parallel</code> and similar functions take
		<code class="keyword">shared</code> lambdas as arguments.
		That means they can only close over values that are safe to share with parallel fibers.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a way to have multiple fibers that share mutable state: give them the same <em>exclusion</em>.
		<br />
		An exclusion is just a number associated with each fiber.
		The fibers queue will only dequeue a fiber if its exclusion isn't already in use,
		meaning two fibers with the same exclusion will never run at the same time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like <code class="type">fiber</code>, you won't reference the <code class="type">exclusion</code> type directly.
		<code>with : later</code> works like <code>with : parallel</code> but reuses the calling fiber's exclusion.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			xs string mut[] = ()
			f0 void future = with : later
				xs ~= "hello"
			f1 void future = with : later
				xs ~= "world"
			# await' order is not execution order; 'f0' runs first.
			f1 await
			f0 await
			info log xs.to::json.to
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		In this example there are 3 fibers: One for <code class="function">main</code>,
		and one for each <code class="function">later</code>.
		<br />
		Since all 3 fibers share the same exclusion, the calls to <code class="function">~=</code>
		do not overlap (which would be bad).
	</p>
	<p>
		Both <code class="function">later</code> and <code class="function">parallel</code> create a new fiber,
		but <code class="function">parallel</code> uses a new exclusion (meaning, one never seen before)
		while <code class="function">later</code> shares the exclusion of its caller.
		<br />
		So, <code class="function">later</code> takes a <code class="keyword">mut</code> lambda
		(meaning the closure can include anything),
		while <code class="function">parallel</code> needs a <code class="keyword">shared</code> one
		(meaning the closure can only include <code class="keyword">shared</code> types).
		<br />
		Try changing <code class="function">later</code> to <code class="function">parallel</code>
		above to see the compile error.
	</p>
	<aside>
		<h4>Fibers vs exclusions</h4>
		<p>
			Fibers and exclusions are two separate things and have a many-to-many relationship.
			One exclusion can be shared by multiple fibers.
			One fiber can pass through multiple exclusions as it calls <code class="keyword">shared</code>
			lambdas from other exclusions (though it has only one exclusion at a time).
			So, an exclusion doesn't own its fibers, and a fiber doesn't own its exclusion; they're orthogonal.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<h2>Share any lambda</h2>
	<p>
		If some library you are using expects a <code class="keyword">shared</code> lambda, worry not;
		you can make any lambda <code class="keyword">shared</code> just by putting the
		<code class="keyword">shared</code> keyword before it.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			parts string mut[] = ()
			f void shared(x string) = shared x =>
				parts ~= x
				()
			for x : ("hello", "world")::string[] parallel
				f[x]
			info log (", " join parts.to)
	</crow-runnable>
	<p>
		<code class="keyword">shared</code> wraps the lambda with code that changes its calling fiber's exclusion
		to the exclusion of the fiber that created the lambda (yielding until it's available),
		and changes it back after calling.
		<br />
		That means the above example is not really running in parallel since there is only one call to
		<code class="function">f</code> at a time.
		<br />
		However, they could happen in any order, so, it is possible that it might log "world, hello".
		(This won't happen in the browser which is single-threaded.)
	</p>
	<p>
		When writing code that returns a lambda,
		you should usually make it <code class="keyword">shared</code> to make it easier for the user.
	</p>

<section>
	<h2>Futures and exceptions</h2>
	<p>
		When a fiber throws an exception,
		the future is completed with that exception and will be thrown again at <code class="keyword">await</code>.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			xs string[] = "hello",
			fut string future = with : parallel
				xs[1]
			info log "this is reached"
			x = fut await
			info log "{x} is not reached"
			()
	</crow-runnable>
