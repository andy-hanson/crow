	<h2>Variants</h2>
	<p>
		A <code class="keyword">variant</code> is like a <code class="keyword">union</code>,
		except its members can be declared anywhere.
		<br />
		So, unlike for a <code class="keyword">union</code>,
		you don't know all the members of a <code class="keyword">variant</code>,
		since other unrelated modules could add new members.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log "{15.verified-id is-adult}"
			info log "{60.verified-id is-adult}"
			info log "{no-id is-adult}"

		age variant
		# These could even go in a different module.
		verified-id variant-member(age, nat)
		no-id variant-member(age)

		is-adult bool(a age)
			match a
			as verified-id x
				x >= 18
			as no-id
				false
			# Required for variants (since we don't know if other members might exist)
			else
				false
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		As with a <code class="keyword">union</code>, there is a getter function for each member
		that returns an <code class="type">option</code>.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			a v = 7 m
			if x ?= a m
				info log "{x}"
			()

		v variant
		m variant-member(v, nat)
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		You should generally prefer to use a <code class="keyword">union</code>
		instead of a <code class="keyword">variant</code>.
		<br />
		They were added to support letting users define custom <code class="type">exception</code>s.
