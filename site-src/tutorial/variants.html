	<h2>Variants</h2>
	<p>
		A <code class="keyword">variant</code> is a type that acts like a <code class="keyword">union</code>
		of each type that declares itself a <code class="keyword">variant-member</code>.
		<br />
		A variant is open-ended, somewhat like an <code class="keyword">abstract class</code> in other languages.
		Or you could think of it as a union that's been scattered into separate declarations.
	</p>

	<p>
		<code class="keyword">variant-member</code> is not a subtype;
		the variant type and member type variant need explicit conversion.
		<br />
		It's also not inheritance. Making a type a <code class="keyword">variant-member</code> doesn't alter the type;
		it alters the <em>variant</em> to have a new member.
		<br />
	</p>

	<p>
		<code class="keyword">variant-member</code> parses like any other modifier and can be mixed with them.
		A type can have any number of <code class="keyword">variant-member</code> declarations.
		So you could write: <code>r record(xs nat mut[]) mut, foo variant-member, bar variant-member</code>.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log 10.crow.describe
			info log duck.describe

			c crow = 11,
			info log c.to.describe

		bird variant
		# These could even go in a different module.
		crow record(height nat) bird variant-member
		duck record bird variant-member

		describe string(a bird)
			match a
			as crow x
				"A {x.height}cm crow"
			as duck
				"A duck"
			# 'else' is required for variants
			else
				"Something else"
	</crow-runnable>


	<p>
		Each <code class="keyword">variant-member</code> generates these functions:
	</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li>A <code class="function">to</code> function for converting to the variant.</li>
		<li>A function with the type's name that converts back from the variant to an option of the type.</li>
		<li>
			For records, a function with the type's name that constructs it as a variant directly.
			(So you can write <code>10.crow</code> instead of <code>(10,)::crow.to</code>.)
		</li>
	</ul>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			m m = 7,
			v v = m to
			back m? = v m
			if x ?= back
				info log "{x value}"
			()

		v variant
		m record(value nat) v variant-member
	</crow-runnable>

	<h2>Methods</h2>

	<p>
		Since variants are open-ended, it's not possible to handle all members in a <code class="keyword">match</code>.
		<br />
		If you do want to make sure every member implements something, the variant can declare <em>method</em>s.
		Then each <code class="keyword">variant-member</code> must appear in a scope
		where the method is implemented for the member type.
	</p>
	<p>
		Methods share the same syntax as <code class="keyword">spec</code> signatures.
		Each method declared generates a function for calling it, where the variant is the first parameter.
		<br />
		Each method implementation should have the <code class="keyword">variant-memmber</code>
		type as the first parameter.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log 10.crow.describe
			info log duck.describe

		bird variant
			describe string()
		crow record(height nat) bird variant-member
		duck record bird variant-member

		describe string(a crow)
			"A {a height}cm crow"
		describe string(_ duck)
			"A duck"
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		The method implementations are just regular functions.
		<br />
		They don't need anything to mark them as method implementations, they are in the searched for in the
		<code class="keyword">variant-member</code>'s scope based on the method's signature.
	</aside>

	<p>
		Methods can take any number of parameters. The variant is always inserted at the front.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		import
			crow/math/vec

		main void()
			shapes shape[] = ((5, 5) circle 5), (0 rect 10, 0, 10)
			for shape : shapes
				info log "{shape has-point (1, 1)}"

		shape variant
			has-point bool(point vec2)
		circle record(center vec2, radius float) shape variant-member
		rect record(left float, right float, bottom float, top float) shape variant-member

		has-point bool(a circle, point vec2)
			(point - a.center).length &lt;= a.radius
		has-point bool(a rect, point vec2)
			a.left &lt;= point.x && point.x &lt;= a.right &&
			a.bottom &lt;= point.y && point.y &lt;= a.top
	</crow-runnable>

	<h2>Variants vs unions</h2>

	<p>
		When in doubt, you should use a union.
		Since all members of the union are known, you can <code class="keyword">match</code> on it
		without needing an <code class="keyword">else</code> branch.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since you can convert from a variant to its member types,
		it's not the best option for an interface that is supposed to be only accessed through its methods.
		For that, instead use {{tutorial/lambdas}}.
	</p>
	<p>
		The advantage of a variant is extensibility. For example, the code defining <code class="type">exception</code>
		doesn't need to know every exception that might exist, so it's a <code class="keyword">variant</code>
		to allow other code to define exceptions.
		<br />
		In the case of exceptions, we do want to be able to convert to the particular exception type,
		and not just rely on an interface common to all exceptions.
