	<h2>Compiling to JavaScript</h2>
	<p>
		Most Crow code can be compiled to JavaScript.
		<br />
		The exception is any code relying on <code>extern native</code> or any other <code>extern</code> library.
		That will be explained in {{tutorial/extern}}.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable run-js>
		import
			crow/js: call, js-global

		main void() trusted, js extern
			_ = "alert".js-global call "Hello, JS!"::string
			info log "This goes to log below"
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		On this page, examples will run in the browser instead of using the interpreter.
		Logging will still be redirected to output though.
	</aside>

	<p>
		Currently, there's no way to generate imports.
		If you want to use a third-party JS library, the easiest way is to write it to a global that Crow can access.
