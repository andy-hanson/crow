	<h2>terminology</h2>

	<h4>runtime</h4>
	<p>
		Crow doesn't depend on an <em>external</em> runtime;
		you don't <code>crow</code> installed to run compiled crow code.
		<br />
		However, there is "runtime" code compiled into every crow program.
		<br />
		Standard library code dealing with things like tasks management is called the runtime.
	</p>

	<h4>fut</h4>
	<p>
		A <code class="struct">fut</code> ("future") reserves space for a value that is
		not available immediately and will be filled in later.
		<br />
		For example, it might store the result of an HTTP request.
		<br />
		(A fut can sometimes have a value immediately.
		<code>x,</code> creates a <code class="struct">fut</code> already resolved to <code>x</code>.)
	</p>

	<h4>resolving</h4>
	<p>
		When the value of a <code class="struct">fut</code> is filled in, this is called <em>resolving</em> it.
		<br />
		Before this has happened, the fut is <em>unresolved</em>; afterwards it is <em>resolved</em>.
	</p>

	<h4>task</h4>
	<p>
		A <em>task</em> is a function returning a <code class="struct">fut</code>.
		All code that runs, runs as part of a task (except for the runtime itself).
		<br />
		<code class="fun">main</code> is the first task and can launch other tasks.
	</p>

	<h4>thread</h4>
	<p>
		A <em>thread</em> means a Posix thread (pthread). Normal crow code deals with tasks, not threads.
	</p>

	<h4>task scheduler</h4>
	<p>
		Part of the runtime is the <em>task scheduler</em>.
		This stores all of the tasks that have yet to be run.
		<br />
		The runtime manages threads, and when a thread is done running a task,
		it will take another one from the task scheduler (if the <em>exclusion</em> allows it).
		<br />
		This means there can be many more tasks than threads, since threads are reused for different task.
	</p>

	<h4>exclusion</h4>
	<p>
		A task may reference a closure that may be mutable.
		<br />
		Each task has an <em>exclusion</em>, which is just a number.
		<br />
		If two tasks reference the same mutable data, they will have the same exclusion.
		(They may also have the same exclusion without sharing mutable data.)
		<br />
		If two tasks have the same exclusion, they will not run at the same time.
	</p>

<section>
	<h2>function references</h2>
	<crow-runnable src="ref"></crow-runnable>
	<p>
		In addition to <code class="keyword">fun</code> and <code class="keyword">act</code>,
		there is a third type of function value: <code class="struct">ref</code>.
		<br />
		Calling a <code class="keyword">fun</code> or <code class="keyword">act</code>
		evaluates the function immediately, but calling a <code class="keyword">ref</code>
		schedules a task to evaluate the function.
		<br />
		So, calling a <code class="keyword">ref</code> always returns a <code class="keyword">fut</code>.
		<br />
		The syntax makes this implicit, so a <code>ref nat(str)</code> returns a <code>fut nat</code>.
		<br />
		The body of the <code class="keyword">ref</code> also must return a <code class="struct">fut</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <code class="keyword">ref</code> stores an exclusion; calling it creates a task with that exclusion.
		<br />
		The <code class="keyword">ref</code>'s exclusion is the same as the task that created it,
		even if it doesn't have any mutable data in its closure.
		<br />
		That means that merely creating a <code class="keyword">ref</code>
		doesn't make your code run in parallel. We'll get to how to do that later.
	</p>

	<h3>fut chaining</h3>
	<p>
		There may be some confusion here:
		<br />
		Calling <code>greet["crow"]</code> returns a <code class="struct">fut</code> <em>immediately</em>
		and schedules the function body (with the <code class="fun">print</code> and <code>()</code>)
		to run <em>later</em>.
		<br />
		Later, that body will return <code>()</code>,
		which is a <em>different</em> <code class="struct">fut</code> value.
		<br />
		It will be forwarded to the <code class="struct">fut</code>
		that was returned immediately by <code>greet["crow"]</code>.
		<br />
		Since the <code class="struct">fut</code>s are chained in this way,
		we can treat the <code class="struct">fut</code> that was returned immediately
		<em>as if</em> it's the one that was returned later.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>then</h2>

	<code class="fun">then</code> allows you to schedule work to be done once a
	<code class="struct">fut</code> is resolved.
	<br />

	<crow-runnable src="then"></crow-runnable>

	<p>
		<code class="fun">then</code> is a function that takes a
		<code class="struct">fut</code> and a <code class="keyword">ref</code>.
		<br />
		Once the <code class="struct">fut</code> is resolved,
		it will call the <code class="struct">ref</code> using the resolved value.
		<br />
		<code class="fun">then</code> returns a ref for the eventual result of that,
		which is suitable for calling <code class="fun">then</code> on again.
		<br />
		In this way, you can write a series of tasks that should happen in sequence,
		without having to block waiting on anything.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice how the <code class="keyword">ref</code> is called later,
		even though the value of <code class="local">a</code> is available immediately.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is no parallelism in this example; there are no two tasks capable of running at the same time,
		since all of the <code class="keyword">ref</code>s inherit the exclusion of <code class="fun">main</code>.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2><code>&lt;-</code> syntax</h2>
	Since <code class="fun">then</code> is common, there's a special syntax for calling it.
	<crow-runnable src="then2"></crow-runnable>
	<p>
		This is like the previous example, but using the special syntax.
		<br />
		<code>x &lt;- a</code> is like <code>a then x =></code>,
		with all the the below lines getting nested inside the <code class="keyword">=></code>.
		<br />
		(Meaning each <code class="keyword"><-</code> introduces a new level of nesting,
		which is exactly why this special syntax exists â€” to avoid excessive visual nesting.)
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>launch</h2>
	<code class="fun">launch</code> adds a task with a new exclusion, allowing it to run in parallel.
	<crow-runnable src="launch"></crow-runnable>
	<p>
		The interpreter used on this website has only one thread,
		so this example will be deterministic if run here.
		<br />
		If you run the program from the command line,
		you may see <code>Hello from b</code> printed before <code>Hello from a</code>,
		since those tasks run in parallel.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code class="fun">launch</code> takes a <code class="struct">fun</code>.
		A <code class="struct">fun</code> can't have anything <code class="spec">mut</code> in its closure,
		ensuring that it's safe to run in parallel.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h3>Communication between tasks</h3>

	<p>
		Although a <code>fun</code> can't have anything <code class="keyword">mut</code> in its closure,
		it can have a <code class="keyword">ref</code>,
		and the <code class="keyword">ref</code> can have mutable data in <em>its</em> closure.
	</p>
	<p>
		Though this technically gives one task a reference to another task's mutable data,
		it is safe because a <code class="keyword">ref</code> only allows the caller to ask
		for the function to be scheduled;
		the <code class="keyword">ref</code>'s exclusion will ensure that it only runs one at a time.
	</p>
	<br />
	This allows parallel tasks to safely communicate by referencing each other's functions.

	<crow-runnable src="launch-with-closure"></crow-runnable>

	<p>
		Again, there is only one thread on this website, so you'll have to run on the command line
		to see that <code class="local">values</code> can come in arbitrary order.
		<br />
		There will be no doubled or missing values
		(when you include <code class="local">final-value</code>),
		since <code>get-and-set</code> has an exclusion that ensures it will only run one at a time.
	</p>

	<p>
		<code class="struct">store</code> had to be marked <code class="keyword">sendable</code>
		because it contains <code class="keyword">ref</code>s.
		<br />
		<code class="keyword">sendable</code> means:
		immutable data, <code class="struct">fut</code>, or <code class="keyword">ref</code>.
		<br />
		In the future, it may also include concurrent collections.
		<br />
		As contrasted with immutable data, <code class="keyword">sendable</code> data
		can't be used as a key in a dictionary.
	</p>
	<p>
		More functions for <code class="struct">fut</code> are in the
		<a href="/doc/crow/fut.html">crow/fut</a> module.
