	<h2>Expected types</h2>

	<p>
		Many expressions in crow can have multiple possible types.
		<br />
		For example:
	</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li>
			<code class="lit-num">7</code> can be a <code class="struct">nat</code>,
			<code class="struct">int</code>, or <code class="struct">float</code> (and more).
		</li>
		<li>
			<code class="lit-str">"foo"</code> can be a <code class="struct">string</code> or
			<code class="struct">symbol</code>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>()</code> calls <code>new</code> with no arguments.
			This function has many overloads returning different types.
		</li>
		<li>
			In general, any two functions may differ only in their return type.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The meaning of an expression may be disambiguated based on its context.
		The term for this is an <em>expected type</em>.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			b bool = ()
			n nat = ()
			s string = ()
			info log "b is {b}, n is {n}, s is '{s}'"
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		When an expected type is missing, the type-checker will still attempt to check the expression.
		But, this may lead to a compile error.
		<br />
		Keep this in mind, since many compile errors can be fixed by adding an expected type.
	</p>
</section>

	<h2>Contexts that have an expected type</h2>
	<p>
		An expected type will be present in these cases:
	</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li>
			<strong>From a return type:</strong>
			The expression returned from a function has the type the function was declared to return.
			<crow-runnable>
				main void()
					() # void
			</crow-runnable>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>From a function parameter:</strong>
			When a function has only one remaining overload possible,
			an argument to it has the type of the corresponding parameter.
			<crow-runnable>
				main void()
					() call-me # () is nat
				call-me void(_ nat)
					() # void
			</crow-runnable>

			<p>Overloads are filtered by the expected return type.</p>
			<crow-runnable>
				main void()
					() call-me # () is nat
				call-me void(_ nat)
					() # void
				# This overload can be ignored because it returns 'bool'
				# and the callsite expects 'void'.
				call-me bool(a bool)
					a
			</crow-runnable>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>From special expressions:</strong>
			Any expression not at the end of a block must be <code class="struct">void</code>.
			<br />
			The condition of an <code class="keyword">if</code>, <code class="keyword">elif</code>,
			<code class="keyword">unless</code>, <code class="keyword">while</code>,
			or <code class="keyword">until</code> must be a <code class="struct">bool</code>.

			<crow-runnable>
				main void()
					() # void
					if () # bool
						() # void (since the 'if' must be void, so must the branch)
			</crow-runnable>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>From an inline type annotation:</strong>
			There is a <code class="keyword">::t</code> syntax that provides an expected type
			for the expression to its left.
			<br />
			<crow-runnable>
				main void()
					x = () :: nat
					# Converting string to json to string causes it to be quoted
					info log x.to::string.to::json.to
			</crow-runnable>
		</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Contexts that do not have an expected type</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>For an uninitialized local variable:</strong>
			When you write <code>x =</code>, the only way to determine the type of the expression to the right of the
			<code class="keyword">=</code> is to check it without an expected type.
			<br />
			(The type-checker doesn't try to infer based on where the variable is used later.)
			<crow-runnable>
				main void()
					x = () # This will fail to compile
					info log "{x}"
			</crow-runnable>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>When there an unresolved overload:</strong>
			If there are multiple functions with the same name that can't yet be disambiguated,
			an argument won't have an expected type.
			<crow-runnable>
				main void()
					() foo # This will fail to compile
				foo void(_ nat)
					()
				foo void(_ string)
					()
			</crow-runnable>
		</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Defaults</h2>
	<p>
		When there is no expected type, number and string literals will compile anyway using a default type.
		<br />
		(This does not apply if there are multiple expected types from overloads; it's a compile error in that case.)
	</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li>A simple number like <code class="lit-num">0</code> defaults to <code class="struct">nat</code>.</li>
		<li>
			A number with a sign like <code class="lit-num">+1</code> or <code class="lit-num">-1</code>
			defaults to <code class="struct">int</code>.
		</li>
		<li>
			A number with a decimal point like <code class="lit-num">1.5</code>
			defaults to <code class="struct">float</code>.
		</li>
		<li>
			A string literal like <code class="lit-str">"foo"</code> defaults to <code class="struct">string</code>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			n = 0 # nat
			i = +0 # int
			f = 0.0 # float
			s = "" # string
			info log "{n} {i} {f} {s}"
	</crow-runnable>

	<h2>Overloading is safe</h2>
	<p>
		Since there are no implicit conversions in crow, overloading is always unambiguous.
		<br />
		That means that adding a new function will never silently change an existing function call.
		<br />
		Instead, it will always be a compile error if multiple overloads match.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log 7.foo
		foo string(_ nat)
			"nat"
		foo string(_ int)
			"int"
	</crow-runnable>
	<aside class="small">
		You can fix the example by changing it to <code>+7</code> or <code>7::nat</code>.
	</aside>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Type checking runs left-to-right</h2>
	<p>
		Crow always checks expressions top-to-bottom and left-to-right.
		<br />
		It never goes back to re-check something based on future information.
	</p>
	<p>
		When crow looks at all the overloads for a function, it first filters out those
		that can't return the expected type (if any).
		Then it checks arguments left-to-right, filtering out overloads that can't accept the actual argument types.
		<br />
		That means that in general, first argument of a function will often not have an expected type,
		while the last argument usually will.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			x nat = 0
			a = 0::nat == x
			b = x == 0
			info log "{a} {b}"
	</crow-runnable>
	<p>
		In <code>0::nat == x</code>, the annotation <code>0::nat</code> is needed
		to decide whether to call <code>== bool(a int, b int)</code> or <code>== bool(a nat, b nat)</code>.
		<br />
		In <code>x == 0</code>, <code>x</code> is checked first and is known to be a <code>nat</code>.
		So, the only remaining <code>==</code> overload is <code>== bool(a nat, b nat)</code>.
	</p>
