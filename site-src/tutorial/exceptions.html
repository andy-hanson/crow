	<h2>Throwing exceptions</h2>

	Sometimes a function has no correct return value given its inputs and should throw an exception instead.
	For example, <code class="function">+</code> on <code class="type">nat</code>s will throw an exception if
	the result is too big to represent.

	There are 3 keywords for throwing exceptions, each having basically the same effect.

	<h3>Assertions</h3>
	<p>
		<code class="keyword">assert</code> is the most common way to conditionally throw an exception.
		It throws an exception if the condition is false.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			assert 3 &lt; 2
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">There is no difference between assertion failures and exceptions.</aside>

	<p>
		A custom error message can be written after a <code class="keyword">:</code>.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			assert 3 &lt; 2 : "custom message"
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		<code class="keyword">forbid</code> is like <code class="keyword">assert</code> but the condition is negated,
		meaning it throws if the condition is true.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			forbid 2 &lt; 3
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		<code class="keyword">throw</code> throws an exception unconditionally.
		It takes the error message. This can be any expression of type <code class="type">string</code>.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			throw "error message"
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		<code class="keyword">throw</code> is an expression. It can provide any expected type.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			xs string[nat] = (1, "one"), (2, "two")
			info log (xs[1] ?? throw "Nothing for 1")
			info log (xs[3] ?? throw "Nothing for 3")
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		There is also a helpful function <code class="function">is</code> for asserting equality.
		<br />
		This acts like <code>assert x == y</code>, but converts arguments to JSON for the error message.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			x (nat, string) = (1, "a")
			x is (1, "b")
	</crow-runnable>

<section>
	<h2>Catching exceptions</h2>
	<p>
		There is no dedicated <code class="keyword">try-catch</code> syntax,
		but there is a <code class="keyword">catch</code> function.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void() unsafe
			match (() => try-me) catch
			as ok value
				info log "Succeeded with {value}"
			as error e
				error log "Failed with: {e}"

		try-me nat()
			throw "not today"
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside>
		<h4>Exceptions in crow</h4>
		<p>
			Crow deliberately has only one type of exception.
			<br />
			You can't define exception "subclasses" as in Java.
			Those are often used for functions that can return in multiple different ways.
			<br />
			Instead of using exceptions, return a <code class="keyword">union</code> with all the possible results.
			<br />
			In other words, <code class="keyword">match</code> instead of <code class="keyword">catch</code>.
			<br />
			For example, <code>map[key]</code> just returns an option that is empty if the key is not fund.
		</p>
		<p>
			You should usually not have to catch exceptions.
			An exception indicates a bug, so you should fix the bug instead of catching it.
			<br />
			For example, if indexing into a list <code>xs[i]</code> caused an exception,
			fix the code to test <code>i</code> first.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<h3>Ensuring code is run</h3>
	<p>
		There is also <code class="function">finally</code>
		to ensure that cleanup code is run even when there is an exception.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			with : (() => info log "cleanup") finally
				throw "error"
	</crow-runnable>
