	<h2>Throwing exceptions</h2>

	<p>
		Crow supports exceptions in a similar way to other languages.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			throw "Oh no!" error
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		<code class="keyword">throw</code> takes an <code class="type">exception</code> argument.
		<code class="type">exception</code> is a variant type and <code class="function">error</code> is a
		<code class="keyword">variant-member</code> of it.
		<br />
		(For a refresher: {{tutorial/variants}})
		<br />
	</p>

	<p>
		<code class="keyword">throw</code> is an expression that can provide any expected type.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			xs string[nat] = (1, "one"), (2, "two")
			info log (xs[1] ?? throw "Nothing for 1" error)
			info log (xs[3] ?? throw "Nothing for 3" error)
	</crow-runnable>

	<h3>"Assert" and "Forbid"</h2>

	<p>
		In most cases an exception is not thrown unconditionally.
		<code class="keyword">assert</code> and <code class="keyword">forbid</code>
		are shorthand for conditionally throwing exceptions.
		<br />
		<code class="keyword">assert</code> throws an exception if its condition is <code class="function">false</code>,
		and <code class="keyword">forbid</code> throws if its condition is <code class="function">true</code>.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			assert 2::nat &lt; 3
			forbid 3::nat &lt; 4
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		By default, these throw <code class="function">error</code> exceptions.
		A custom exception can be written after a <code class="keyword">:</code>.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			assert 3::nat &lt; 2 : divide-by-0
	</crow-runnable>
	<aside class="small">
		(<code class="enumMember">divide-by-0</code> is defined in {{doc/number}}.)
	</aside>

	<p>
		Like a <code class="keyword">guard</code>, an <code class="keyword">assert</code> can take an option condition.
		<br />
		The unwrapped option is available below the <code class="keyword">assert</code>, otherwise an error is thrown.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			xs nat mut[] = 1,
			assert x ?= xs pop
			info log "got {x}"
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		<code class="keyword">forbid</code> can also take an option condition,
		and the unwrapped value is available in the exception expression.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			xs nat mut[] = 1,
			forbid x ?= xs pop : "Unexpectedly popped {x}" error
	</crow-runnable>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Catching exceptions</h2>

	<p>
		You can also <code class="keyword">catch</code> exceptions.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log try
				"{1::nat / 0}"
			catch divide-by-0
				"not a number"
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		Just like for an <code class="keyword">if</code>, both branches of the
		<code class="keyword">try</code> expression should return the same type,
		in this case <code class="type">string</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <code class="keyword">catch</code> works like an <code class="keyword">as</code> in a
		<code class="keyword">match</code>, where the thing being matched is the exception.
		<br />
		You can have multiple <code class="keyword">catch</code> handlers for different possible exceptions.
		<br />
		If there is no exception or the exception does not match the expected
		<code class="keyword">variant-member</code>, the <code class="keyword">catch</code> has no effect.
	</p>

	<p>
		There is a minor issue above: The <code class="keyword">try</code> wraps both the division
		and the conversion to a string.
		Often you want precise control over exactly which expression has its exceptions caught.
		<br />
		To make that more convenient, you can combine <code class="keyword">try</code> and
		<code class="keyword">=</code>:
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			try x nat = 1 / 0 catch divide-by-0 : error log "Boo"
			info log "{x}"
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		Above, exceptions will only be caught in <code>1 / 0</code>, not in anything below.
		<br />
		Like a <code class="keyword">guard</code>, this has two branches:
		A success branch below and an error branch to the right.
		<br />
		It's asymmetric since the error branch is generally shorter and less important.
	</p>
	<p>
		As with a <code class="keyword">guard</code>,
		the <code class="keyword">:</code> branch is optional and defaults to <code>()</code>.
		So the below will not log anything.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			try x nat = 1 / 0 catch divide-by-0
			info log "{x}"
	</crow-runnable>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Defining an exception type</h2>
	<p>
		Since <code class="type">exception</code> is just a <code class="keyword">variant</code>,
		a custom exception is a <code class="keyword">variant-member</code>.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			try
				for i : 1::nat .. 12
					info log "12 / {i} = {12 must-divide-by i}"
			catch not-divisible x
				error log "{x}"

		not-divisible record(numerator nat, denominator nat) exception variant-member
		show string(a not-divisible)
			"{a numerator} was not divisible by {a denominator}"

		must-divide-by nat(a nat, b nat)
			assert a is-multiple-of b : a not-divisible b
			a / b
	</crow-runnable>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>"Finally"</h2>
	<p>
		Crow supports a "finally" expression that works like in other languages, but with different syntax.
		<br />
		It is a single line, where the argument to <code class="keyword">finally</code> runs <em>after</em>
		the code below it (regardless of whether the below code throws an exception).
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log "start"
			finally info log "end"
			info log "middle"
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		The reason it's done this way is that typically <code class="keyword">finally</code>
		is used to clean something up, so it's best to put it right after the thing it cleans up
		to be sure you don't forget.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		import
			system/stdlib: free, malloc

		main void() unsafe, (libc, native) extern
			x nat8 mut* = 1 malloc
			finally x free
			*x := 1

			y nat8 mut* = 1 malloc
			# 'y' is freed before 'x'.
			finally y free
			*y := 2

			info log "{*x + *y}"
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		Pointers will be explained in {{tutorial/low-level}}.
		<br />
		<code class="keyword">extern</code> will be explained in {{tutorial/extern}}.
	</aside>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Catching all exceptions</h2>
	<p>
		There's no syntax for this, but there is a <code class="keyword">catch-all</code> function.
		It returns a <code>(t, exception-and-backtrace) result</code>. More details in {{doc/exception}}.
	</p>
	<p>
		You normally don't need to call this as you could just rely on the default exception handler.
		But this would give you the opportunity to format your own custom exceptions.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void() unsafe
			match (() => foo) catch-all
			as ok x
				info log "{x}"
			as error e
				error log "Caught: {e}"

		foo nat()
			bar

		bar nat()
			1 / 0
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside>
		Showing the backtrace is <code class="keyword">unsafe</code> because it is implementation-specific.
		<br />
		It depends on the OS, and on whether the code was optimized or interpreted.
