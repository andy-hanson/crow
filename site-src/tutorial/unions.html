	<h2>Declaring unions</h2>
	<p>
		While a record stores all of the values declared in it,
		a union will store only one of the choices available.
		<br />
		This is useful for a value that can have one of several non-overlapping states.
	</p>

	<aside class="small">Union members can't be mutable.</aside>

		main nat^(_ string[])
			info log "{15.verified-id is-adult}"
			info log "{60.verified-id is-adult}"
			info log "{no-id is-adult}"
			()

		age union
			verified-id nat
			no-id

		is-adult bool(a age)
			match a
			as verified-id x
				x >= 18
			as no-id
				false

		<h4>Why unions?</h4>
		<p>
			If a special value such as 99 were used to indicate <code>no-id</code>,
			then it would have been easy to accidentally implement <code class="fun">is-adult</code>
			as just <code>a >= 18</code>, which would have wrongly accepted an unknown age.
		</p>
		<p>
			Similarly, if it were a record with two fields <code>age</code> and <code>missing-id</code>,
			it would be easy to forget to check <code>missing-id</code>.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<h3>Creating union values</h3>
	<p>
		Declaring the union generates functions <code>verified-id age(a nat)</code> and <code>no-id age()</code>.
	</p>

	<h3>Matching on union values</h3>
	<p>
		The <code class="keyword">match</code> expression handles each possibility of a union.
		<br />
		Like an <code class="keyword">if</code> expression, each branch is an expression
		with the same type as the whole <code class="keyword">match</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The branches need to come in the same order as the union members.
		<br />
		It's a compile error to be missing branches (no implicit <code>()</code>).
		<br />
		If a member has a value, it must be declared after the name.
		This uses the same destructuring syntax as for locals.
		(So to ignore a value, use <code>_</code>.)
	</p>

	<aside class="small">
		<code class="keyword">match</code> is a language primitive and isn't downleveled to a function call.
