	<h2>Declaring unions</h2>
	<p>
		While a record stores all of the values declared in it,
		a union will store only one of the choices available.
		<br />
		This is useful for a value that can have one of several non-overlapping states.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log "{15.verified-id is-adult}"
			info log "{60.verified-id is-adult}"
			info log "{no-id is-adult}"

		age union(verified-id nat, no-id)

		is-adult bool(a age)
			match a
			as verified-id x
				x >= 18
			as no-id
				false
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside>
		<h4>Why unions?</h4>
		<p>
			If a special value such as 99 were used to indicate <code>no-id</code>,
			then it would have been easy to accidentally implement <code class="function">is-adult</code>
			as just <code>a >= 18</code>, which would have wrongly accepted an unknown age.
		</p>
		<p>
			Similarly, if it were a record with two fields <code>age</code> and <code>missing-id</code>,
			it would be easy to forget to check <code>missing-id</code>.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<h3>Creating union values</h3>
	<p>
		Declaring the union generates functions <code>verified-id age(a nat)</code> and <code>no-id age()</code>.
	</p>

	<h3>Long unions</h3>
	<p>As with records, you can put the members on their own lines instead of in parentheses.</p>
	<crow-runnable no-run>
		age union
			verified-id nat
			no-id
	</crow-runnable>

	<h2>Matching on union values</h2>
	<p>
		The <code class="keyword">match</code> expression handles each possibility of a union.
		<br />
		Like an <code class="keyword">if</code> expression, each branch is an expression
		with the same type as the whole <code class="keyword">match</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If a member has a value, it must be declared after the name,
		like <code>x</code> in <code>as verified-id x</code>.
		<br />
		This uses the same destructuring syntax as for locals.
		(So to ignore a value, use <code>_</code>.)
	</p>
	<p>
		An <code>else</code> branch is required when matching on a union unless all cases are handled.
		<br />
		(This is explicit to avoid accidentally forgetting a case.)
	</p>

	<aside class="small">
		In contrast with record field access, <code class="keyword">match</code> is a
		primitive operation and not a function call.
	</aside>

	<h2>Matching on other values</h2>
	<p>
		You can also match on other types:
	</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li>
			String-like types:
			<code class="type">symbol</code>, <code class="type">string</code>,
			<code class="type">char8 array</code>, <code class="type">char8[]</code>
			<code class="type">char32 array</code>, <code class="type">char32[]</code>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Integral types:
			<code class="type">nat8</code>, <code class="type">nat16</code>,
			<code class="type">nat32</code>, <code class="type">nat64</code>,
			<code class="type">int8</code>, <code class="type">int16</code>,
			<code class="type">int32</code>, <code class="type">int64</code>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		A <code class="keyword">match</code> on these types has an implicit
		<code class="keyword">else</code> just like for an <code class="keyword">if</code>.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log ("chocolate" order 1)
			info log ("pizza" order 2)

		order string(a string, count nat)
			plural = a plural count
			if c ?= a condiment
				"{plural} with {c}"
			else
				plural

		condiment string?(a string)
			match a
			as chocolate
				"peanut butter",
			as "french fries"
				"ketchup",

		plural string(a string, count nat)
			match count
			as 0
				"no {a}s"
			as 1
				"one {a}"
			else
				"{count} {a}s"
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		<code>as chocolate</code> is the same as <code>as "chocolate"</code>.
		<br />
		Quotes are not required if it is a valid identifier.
