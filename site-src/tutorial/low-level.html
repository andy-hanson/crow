	<h2>Unsafe code</h2>
	<p>
		Crow is normally safe. Normal Crow functions can't do bad things like:
	</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li>Allocate memory and never free it.</li>
		<li>Free memory, then access it anyway.</li>
		<li>Access global state.</li>
		<li>
			Have different behavior on different environments (like endianness or the operating system).
			<br />
			(A function that simply prints the name of your operating system would be safe,
			but <code class="keyword">summon</code>.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Access other information not explicitly passed through parameters, like a stack trace.
		</li>
		<li>
			Access private information about data structures.
			(E.g., distinguish two equal values based on reference identity.)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		However, unsafe Crow running natively can do anything C can.
		<br />
		Although most code should do things the safe way,
		unsafe functionality is available in functions marked <code class="keyword">unsafe</code>.
		<br />
		You can also mark any of your own functions <code class="keyword">unsafe</code>
		if it must be called in a particular way.
		<br />
		An <code class="keyword">unsafe</code> function can call other <code class="keyword">unsafe</code> functions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many (but not all) <code class="keyword">unsafe</code> operations
		also require the function to be marked <code>native extern</code>.
		This will be explained in {{tutorial/extern}} instead of here.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void() unsafe, native extern
			x string* = null
			info log "{x.to::nat}"
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		Remove <code class="keyword">unsafe</code> from the declaration of <code class="function">main</code>
		to see compile errors.
	</aside>

	<p>
		The above example prints <code>0</code> because that happens to be the representation of a null pointer.
	</p>

</section>
<section>
	<h2>"Trusted" expressions</h2>
	<p>
		When a function is <code class="keyword">unsafe</code>,
		it doesn't mean that every time you use it, it will do something bad.
		<br />
		It just means that it <em>could</em>, and the compiler can't verify that it won't.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're calling an unsafe function in a way that won't do something bad, you can mark the use as
		<code class="keyword">trusted</code>.
		<br />
		<code class="keyword">trusted</code> parses as a prefix, just like <code class="keyword">throw</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A common example of this is <code class="function">+</code> functions on integer types,
		which check for overflow/underflow before calling a primitive unchecked add function.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		import
			system/stdio: stdout
			system/unistd: write

		main void() summon, (native, posix) extern
			message nat8 array = "hello\n"::string to-bytes
			_ = trusted stdout write message.begin-pointer, message.size
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		<code>(native, posix) extern</code> will be explained in {{tutorial/extern}}.
	</aside>

	<p>
		The above example calls the Posix <code class="function">write</code> function,
		which is dangerous in general; it takes a pointer and length separately and does bad things
		if length is wrong.
		<br />
		(Anything involving pointers is unsafe; so <code class="function">begin-pointer</code> is also unsafe.)
		<br />
		But in this example, we know that the length is correct,
		making the call to <code class="function">write</code> safe.
	</p>

	<p>
		The entire argument expression to <code class="keyword">trusted</code> may contain unsafe functions.
	</p>

	<p>
		When deciding whether to mark a function as <code class="keyword">unsafe</code> or to use
		<code class="keyword">trusted</code> in its body,
		ask whether a malicious caller could cause the function to bad things.
		(For example, a function taking pointer parameters is almost always <code class="keyword">unsafe</code>,
		since it can't guarantee that the pointers are valid.)
		<br />
		If so, always mark it as <code class="keyword">unsafe</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		For convenience, <code class="keyword">trusted</code> can also be used as a function modifier.
		This makes the entire function body <code class="keyword">trusted</code>.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Pointers</h2>

	<p>
		Crow supports pointers like in C.
		You can manually allocate memory, and mark the code <code class="keyword">trusted</code>
		if you've ensured it will be freed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike in C, pointers are "const" by default.
		<code class="type">nat*</code> is a readable pointer;
		<code class="type">nat mut*</code> is readable and writable.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		import
			system/stdlib: free, malloc

		main void() trusted, (libc, native) extern
			ptr nat mut* = new-nat
			finally ptr free-nat
			*ptr := 3
			info log "{*ptr}"

		new-nat nat mut*() unsafe, (libc, native) extern
			(size-of@nat).malloc pointer-cast
		free-nat void(a nat mut*) unsafe, (libc, native) extern
			a.pointer-cast free
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		<code>libc</code> will be explained in {{tutorial/extern}}.
	</aside>

	<p>
		As in C, you can use <code>&x</code> to get a pointer to a local variable.
		<br />
		As in C, this is dangerous if the pointer outlives the stack.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void() trusted, native extern
			x mut nat = 1
			ptr nat mut* = &x
			*ptr := 2
			info log "{x}"
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		The above can be <code class="keyword">trusted</code>
		because the pointer doesn't outlive <code class="local">x</code>.
	</p>

	<aside class="small">
		We need the <code class="keyword">mut</code> in <code>x mut nat</code>
		so the pointer can be a <code>nat mut*</code> and not a <code>nat*</code>.
	</aside>

	<h3>Converting mutable and read-only pointers</h3>

	<p>
		Crow doesn't have any implicit conversions.
		To convert a constant to a mutable pointer, use <code class="function">as-mut</code>.
		To convert back, use <code class="function">as-const</code>.
	</p>

	<aside class="small">These functions are defined in {{doc/pointer}}.</aside>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void() trusted, native extern
			x mut nat = 1
			mut-ptr nat mut* = &x
			const-ptr nat* = mut-ptr as-const
			*mut-ptr := 2
			assert const-ptr.as-mut == mut-ptr
			info log "{*const-ptr}"
	</crow-runnable>

	<h3>Accessing data from pointers</h3>

	<p>
		Reading through a pointer is slightly different from in C.
		<br />
		If <code>a</code> is a pointer to a record with a field <code>x</code>,
		<code>a->x</code> reads (or writes) the field.
		<br />
		<code>a.x</code> will also be defined,
		and return an inner pointer of <code>a</code> at the <code>x</code> field.
		<br />
		In C that would be written as <code>&a->x</code>, which is not supported in Crow.
	</p>

	<aside class="small">
		These operations are only defined for <code class="keyword">by-val</code> records.
	</aside>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void() trusted, native extern
			foo mut foo = 1,
			foo-ptr foo mut* = &foo
			x-ptr nat mut* = foo-ptr.x
			foo-ptr->x := 2
			info log "{foo.x} == {foo-ptr->x} == {*x-ptr}"
			*x-ptr := 3
			info log "{foo.x} == {foo-ptr->x} == {*x-ptr}"

		foo record(x mut nat) by-val, mut
	</crow-runnable>

<section>
	<h2>Global variables</h2>

	<p>
		Globals are declared using the <code class="keyword">global</code> keyword.
		<br />
		The below example declares a global <code class="var-decl">x</code>, writes to it, then reads it.
	</p>

	<aside class="small">
		It's important to initialize a global variable before using it.
	</aside>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void() unsafe
			x := 1
			info log "{x}"

		x global(nat)
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		Declaring the global generates a getter function <code class="function">x</code>
		and a setter function <code class="function">set-x</code> (called by <code>x := 1</code>).
		<br />
		Both of these are <code class="keyword">unsafe</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's hard to use a global variable in a safe way. You would have to be sure:
	</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li>The global is only accessed by one thread at a time.</li>
		<li>Global state does not leak across unrelated calls. (Basically, it must "act local".)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Basically, you should never use globals.
		But they are needed to support C libraries that use them.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Thread-local variables</h2>

	<p>
		A thread-local variable works just like a global,
		but it can have a different value for each thread.
		<br />
		This means a real thread, not a crow task.
		Which task gets assigned to which thread is unpredictable, so don't rely on it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Again, these are included for compatibility with C.
		<br />
		They are also used in a few places in the standard library behind the scenes.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			trusted
				x := 1
				info log "{x}"

		x thread-local(nat)
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		The above example can be <code class="keyword">trusted</code>
		because the variable is always written before it is read,
		so state won't leak across unrelated calls.
		<br />
		(We also need to know that <code class="var-decl">x</code> isn't used anywhere else;
		we do know this, since it's private.)
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Function pointers</h2>

	<p>
		There are also function pointer types like in C.
	</p>
	<p>
		A function pointer type is written like a lambda type,
		but with the <code class="keyword">function</code> keyword where the purity would normally appear.
		<br />
		(Function pointers are <code class="keyword">shared</code> since they
		might point to a <code class="keyword">summon</code> function, and so could have side effects.)
		<br />
		To get a function pointer, write <code class="keyword">&</code> followed by the function name.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			f nat function(x nat) = &double
			info log "{f[5]}"

		double nat(a nat)
			a * 2
	</crow-runnable>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>"By-val" and "by-ref"</h2>
	<p>
		Normally, Crow will choose for you whether a record type is a reference type or a value type.
		<br />
		(<code class="keyword">union</code>, <code class="keyword">enum</code>, and <code class="keyword">flags</code>
		are always value types.)
		<br />
		Crow guesses what will have the best performance; it passes small records by value and large records reference.
		If a record has a mutable field, it is always passed by reference
		(to ensure a mutation isn't lost by a copy).
	</p>
	<p>
		You can override the default by explicitly marking a record <code class="keyword">by-val</code> or
		<code class="keyword">by-ref</code>.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void() unsafe, native extern
			# Value type, so its size is the sum of its fields' sizes.
			info log "r1: {size-of@r1}"
			# Reference type, so its size is the size of a pointer.
			info log "r2: {size-of@r2}"

		r1 record(x nat, y nat) by-val
		r2 record(x nat, y nat) by-ref
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		In the above example, the records would behave the same for safe code; the only difference is performance.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>"Bare" functions</h2>

	<p>
		A function may be marked <code class="keyword">bare</code> if it does not use the Crow runtime.
		<br />
		Basically, this means it should not allocate any garbage-collected data.
		That means it can only create records explicitly marked <code class="keyword">by-val</code>.
		It also can't do anything involving tasks,
		such as using <code class="function">then</code> or <code>with : parallel</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The main reason to make a function <code class="keyword">bare</code>
		is if C code might call it in an asynchronous callback.
		Crow code may only allocate if it's part of a Crow fiber, which wouldn't be the case then.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			# non-'bare' can call 'bare'
			foo

		foo void() bare
			# Can't allocate
			_ nat[] = 1,
			# Can't use the runtime
			_ nat = with : parallel
				1
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		A <code class="keyword">bare</code> function can only call other <code class="keyword">bare</code> functions,
		but <em>any</em> function can call a <code class="keyword">bare</code> function.
		<br />
		(E.g., <code class="function">+</code> is <code class="keyword">bare</code> and anything can call it.)
		<br />
		Recall that <code class="keyword">unsafe</code> works in the opposite way.
	</p>

	<aside class="danger">
		<h4>Throwing in "bare" code</h4>
		<p>
			<code class="keyword">bare</code> functions are allowed to throw exceptions.
			(E.g., <code class="function">+</code> is <code class="keyword">bare</code>, and throws on overflow.)
			<br />
			If an exception is thrown and it's not part of a Crow fiber, it might not be caught.
			In that case, the program will abort.
		</p>
