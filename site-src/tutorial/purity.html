	<h2>Levels of purity</h2>
	<p>
		Crow prevents sharing mutable data between different threads.
		The precise details will be explained in {{tutorial/futures}}.
		<br />
		Doing that requires knowing the <em>purity</em> of every type.
		The 3 purity levels are:
	</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td><code class="keyword">data</code></td>
				<td>Immutable values only.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code class="keyword">shared</code></td>
				<td>
					Immutable values, <code class="keyword">fun</code> types,
					and thread-safe mutable values (such as <code class="struct">future</code>s).
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code class="keyword">mut</code></td>
				<td>Allows all values, including ordinary mutable values.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<aside>
		<h4>Data is forever</h4>
		<p>
			This doesn't work like <code class="keyword">const</code> in other languages.
			<br />
			If a type is <code class="keyword">mut</code>, you can't cast it to <code class="keyword">data</code>.
			(You <em>can</em> call <code class="function">to</code>
			to convert a mutable collection to an immutable one.)
			<br />
			This is because we need <code class="keyword">data</code> to be truly immutable,
			not just a read-only reference to something mutable.
		</p>
	</aside>
</section>

	<h2>Declaring purity</h2>

	<p>
		If a type is not <code class="keyword">data</code>,
		it must be marked <code class="keyword">shared</code> or <code class="keyword">mut</code> at the declaration.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		has-data record
			x string

		has-shared record shared
			x string^

		has-mutable record mut
			x string-builder
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		Try removing the <code class="keyword">shared</code> or <code class="keyword">mut</code> keywords
		to see the compile error.
		<br />
		In contrast, it's not a compile error if you mark <code class="struct">has-data</code>
		as <code class="keyword">mut</code>.
	</aside>

	<h3>Purity and "fun"/"act"</h3>

	<p>
		An <code class="keyword">act</code> can have anything in its closure,
		but <code class="keyword">fun</code> can only have <code class="keyword">shared</code>
		(including <code class="keyword">data</code>) values in its closure.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			xs nat mut[] = ()
			f act void() = () =>
				xs ~= 1
			f[]
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		Try changing <code class="keyword">act</code> to <code class="keyword">fun</code> to see the compile error.
	</aside>
	<p>
		As a result, a <code class="keyword">fun</code> type is <code class="keyword">shared</code>
		while an <code class="keyword">act</code> type is <code class="keyword">mut</code>.
	</p>
</section>

	<h2>Benefits of purity</h2>

	<p>
		Purity is deep: If a record has a <code class="keyword">mut</code> field,
		it must be <code class="keyword">mut</code> itself.
		<br />
		To put it in reverse, if a record is <code class="keyword">data</code>,
		then everything it references, and everything they reference, is <code class="keyword">data</code> too.
	</p>

	<p>Two other Crow features also enforce kinds of purity:</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li>Global state is considered unsafe. (Code should behave as if there is no global state.)</li>
		<li>I/O is controlled. For details, see {{tutorial/io}}.</li>
	</ul>

	<aside>
		<h4>Logging and I/O</h4>
		<p>
			Logging is treated differently from other I/O, which is what has allowed
			all of these tutorial examples to be written in pure code.
			<br />
			Logging is not inherently I/O,
			since the log handler is like an implicitly passed <code class="keyword">act</code>.
			This fits into Crow's model of side effects, explained in {{tutorial/io}}.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<p>
		With all these combine, purity creates a "jail" that an ordinary function can't escape from.
		Its parameters form the (only) roots of the graph of data it can access.
		<br />
		If those parameters are <code class="keyword">data</code>, then the entire graph of objects accessible
		to that function is <code class="keyword">data</code>.
		<br />
		It can't modify any state visible to the outside, or do any I/O.
		It's limited to reading data and producing a return value.
		The only thing that matters about such a function is its return value.
		<br />
		It can still create mutable objects of its own, but this is fine since they won't affect anything elsewhere.
