	<h2>Levels of purity</h2>
	<p>
		Every type in crow has a <em>purity</em>.
		The purpose is to control what can be shared between different contexts that may be running in paralle.
		The precise details will be explained in {{tutorial/futures}}.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are 3 levels or purity:
	</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td><code class="keyword">data</code></td>
				<td>Immutable values only.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code class="keyword">shared</code></td>
				<td>
					All <code class="keyword">data</code>, plus values that are mutable in a thread-safe way.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code class="keyword">mut</code></td>
				<td>Allows all types, including ordinary mutable values.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>
		<code class="keyword">data</code> is stricter than "read-only";
		it only allows values that are guaranteed to never change.

		You can't cast mutable data to immutable data, but you can usually call <code class="function">to</code>.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Declaring purity</h2>

	<p>
		Types are assumed <code class="keyword">data</code> by default.
		If not, they must be marked <code class="keyword">shared</code> or
		<code class="keyword">mut</code> at the declaration.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			()

		has-data record
			x string

		has-shared record shared
			# 'string^' is a string future type, which is 'shared'.
			x string^

		has-mutable record mut
			x string-builder
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		Try removing the <code class="keyword">shared</code> or <code class="keyword">mut</code> keywords
		to see the compile error.
		<br />
		In contrast, it's not a compile error if you mark <code class="type">has-data</code>
		as <code class="keyword">mut</code>.

	<h2>Benefits of purity</h2>

	<p>
		Purity is deep: If a record has a <code class="keyword">mut</code> field,
		it must be <code class="keyword">mut</code> itself.
		<br />
		To put it in reverse, if a record is <code class="keyword">data</code>,
		then everything it references, and everything they reference, is <code class="keyword">data</code> too.
	</p>

	<p>Two other Crow features also enforce kinds of purity:</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li>
			Global state is considered unsafe.
			(It may be used, but code should behave <em>as if</em> there is no global state.)
		</li>
		<li>
			For non-<code class="keyword">summon</code> functions, the ability to do I/O must come from a parameter.
			This will be explained in {{tutorial/io}}.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		With these combine, purity creates a "jail" that a (non-<code class="keyword">summon</code>)
		function can't escape from.
		Its parameters are the roots of the graph of all data it can access.
		<br />
		If those parameters are <code class="keyword">data</code>, then the entire graph of objects accessible
		to that function is <code class="keyword">data</code>.
		<br />
		It can't modify any state visible to the outside, or do any I/O.
		It's limited to reading data and producing a return value.
		The only thing that matters about such a function is its return value.
		<br />
		It can still create mutable objects of its own, but this is fine since they won't affect anything elsewhere.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even if some parameter is <code class="keyword">shared</code> or <code class="keyword">mut</code>,
		the function can only access whatever state or side effects are exposed through that parameter.
	</p>

	<aside>
		<h4>Exceptions to purity</h4>
		<ul class="bullets">
		<li>
			All code can <code class="keyword">throw</code> exceptions.
			(But looking at the stack trace is <code class="keyword">unsafe</code>.)
		</li>
		<li>
			All code can call <code class="function">log</code>.
			This is not inherently I/O, since the log handler can be customized.
		</li>
