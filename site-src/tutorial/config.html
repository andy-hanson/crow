	<h2><code>crow-config.json</code></h2>

	<p>
		Each module may have an associated <code>crow-config.json</code> file.
		This is found by searching the same directory as the module; then the parent directory;
		and so on until one is found.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can't configure the same module multiple ways; the config is part of the code.
	</p>
	<p>
		The config applies to the module, not the whole program.
		A single compile may include modules with different configs.
		Type-checking each module depends only on its own config.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some options will only matter for the main config, meaning the config for the main module.
		(When you run <code>crow build foo.crow</code> or <code>crow run foo.crow</code>,
		that makes <code>foo.crow</code> the main module.)
	</p>

	<h2>Library config</h2>
	<p>
		First, look at the config in <code>crow-demo/libraries/SDL2/crow-config.json</code>.
		This config applies to everything in <code>libraries/SDL2</code>.
		<br />
		It's pretty basic:
	</p>

	<code>
		{
			"extern": {
				"SDL2": null
			}
		}
	</code>

	<p>
		This contains everything the library needs; it enables the use of the external library <code>SDL2</code>
		without specifying where it will come from.
	</p>

	<aside class="small">
		"External library" means a non-Crow library like SDL.
		<br />
		A Crow library is just called a "library", even if it's not your own code.
	</aside>

	<h2>Main config</h2>

	<p>
		Now look at <code>crow-demo/sdl/crow-config.json</code>:
	</p>

	<code>
		{
			"include": {
				"SDL2": "../libraries/SDL2"
			},
			"extern": {
				"SDL2": "../extern/SDL2"
			}
		}
	</code>

	<p>
		<code>"include"</code> is for using Crow libraries.
		<br />
		It specifies where imports of <code>SDL2</code> will come from.
		The relative path here is relative to the location of the <code>crow-config.json</code> file.
		<br />
		So, an import of <code>SDL2/SDL_rect</code> will import the module from <code>libraries/SDL2/SDL_rect</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<code>"extern"</code> is for using external libraries.
		This specifies that the machine code for SDL2 will be found in the <code>crow-demo/extern/SDL2</code> directory.
		(Since the path is relative to <code>crow-demo/sdl/crow-config.json</code>.)
		<br />
		(That directory has a <code>.dll</code> but not <code>.so</code>;
		on Linux, it will be searched for in system paths.)
		<br />
		The paths in <code>"extern"</code> only matter for the main config.
		For a library, then can be left <code>null</code>, but they do need to exist to enable referencing the library.
	</p>

	<aside class="small">
		A Crow library containing bindings for an external library will generally have the same name,
		but they are two separate things.
		<br />
		In this example there is <code>SDL2</code>, the Crow library contained in <code>crow-demo/libraries/SDL2</code>, and
		<code>SDL2</code>, the library installed in a place like <code>crow-demo/extern/SDL2/SDl2.dll</code>
		or <code>/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSDL2.so</code>.
	</aside>

	<p>
		Every <code>extern foo</code> expression in a program will be
		<code>true</code> if the <code>extern</code> section of the main config
		has a non-<code>null</code> value for the key <code>"foo"</code>,
		and <code>false</code> otherwise.
	</p>
