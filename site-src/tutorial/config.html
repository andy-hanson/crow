	<h2><code>crow-config.json</code></h2>

	<p>
		Each module may have an associated <code>crow-config.json</code> file.
		This is found by searching the same directory as the module; then the parent directory;
		and so on until one is found.
	</p>
	<p>
		A single compile can include modules with different configs.
		Type-checking each module depends only on its own config.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some options will only matter for the main config, meaning the config for the main module.
		(When you run <code>crow build foo.crow</code> or <code>crow run foo.crow</code>,
		that makes <code>foo.crow</code> the main module.)
	</p>

	<h3>SDL example</h3>
	<p>
		If you haven't already, download the <a href="/download.html#demo">demos</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Take a look at the <code>crow-demo/sdl</code> directory.
		This has a file <code>crow-config.json</code>.
		This has two parts:
	</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li><code>"include"</code> tells crow where to find the crow code that declares SDL2 bindings.</li>
		<li>
			<code>"extern"</code> tells crow where to find the machine code for the library on Windows.
			<br />
			(On Linux, it's should be in the library search path. It should be if you installed SDL normally.)
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Since it specifies <code>"SDL2": "../libraries/SDL2"</code> in the <code>"include"</code> section,
		<code>main.crow</code> can be import it as <code>SDL2/SDL_rect</code> instead of
		<code>../libraries/SDL2/SDL_rect</code>.
	</p>

	PUT THIS SOMEWHERE

	<aside>
		<h4>Specifying the library</h4>
		<p>
			<code>crow build</code> and <code>crow run</code> don't take linker options;
			these are inferred from your code.
			<br />
			If the library needs to be linked to with <code>-lfoo</code>,
			its functions should be declared with <code>foo extern</code> instead of <code>c extern</code>.
			<br />
			For example, SDL functions are declared with <code>SDL2 extern</code>.
			<br />
			If that function is included in the compile, the library name gets added to the linker options.
