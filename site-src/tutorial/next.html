	The crow language is still in an alpha state.
	<br />
	It needs people to test out the language and report <a href="https://github.com/andy-hanson/crow/issues">issues</a>.
</p>
<p>
	If you want to get started using crow, the best thing to do is to pick a small project to work on
	and report on your experience.
	<br />
	This would also be a good opportunity to contribute to the standard library.
