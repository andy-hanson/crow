	<p>In this section, we'll run this "hello world" program using different methods.</p>

	<crow-runnable name="hello.crow">
		main void()
			info log "Hello, world!"
	</crow-runnable>

	<h2>Run in the browser</h3>
	<p>
		Click the <code>â–¶</code> button at the bottom of the code block above to run it in the browser.
		<br />
		The code is editable, so you can test things out there while reading the tutorial.
		<br />
		This supports all Crow standard library functions, but it can't do I/O except for printing.
	</p>

	<h2>Download and run</h3>
	<p>
		Code blocks can be downloaded using the <code>â‡“</code> button.
		<br />
		Alternatively, use the <code>ðŸ“‹</code> button to copy the code and paste it into a file.
	</p>

	<h3>Run with the interpreter</h3>
	<p>
		For the next step, you must <a href='download.html'>download</a> and install crow.
		<br />
		Open a terminal and navigate to <code>crow/demo</code>.
		<br />
		Then, run <code>crow hello.crow</code>.
		<br />
		<code>./hello.crow</code> also works (but not on Windows) thanks to the shebang at the top.
	</p>
	<p>
		The interpreter should be your default option for running code in development,
		since it quickly starts running code.
	</p>

	<h3>Build an executable</h4>
	<p>
		Run <code>crow build hello.crow</code> to generate a standalone executable.
		<br />
		The executable will be called <code>hello</code>, or <code>hello.exe</code> on Windows.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Standalone" means that it can run on a computer that doesn't have <code>crow</code> installed.
		That makes it a good option for deploying code to a server or distributing to users.
	</p>

	<h3>Compile to C</h3>
	<p>
		Run <code>crow build hello.crow --out hello.c</code> to "transpile" to a C program.
		<br />
		The C code is pretty ugly, but it can be useful if you want to use a C debugger to debug Crow code.
		<br />
		A comment at the top of the file contains the compile command to use on it.
	</p>

	<h3>Compile and run</h3>
	<p>
		<code>crow run hello.crow --aot</code> will compile and run native code.
		<br />
		Compared to the interpreter, this takes longer to start but runs faster afterwards.
		(Even more so with the <code>--optimize</code> flag.)
		Use this for big jobs.
		<br />
		This uses the same compiler as <code>crow build</code>, but it cleans up the executable after running.
	</p>

	<h3>Script arguments</h3>
	<p>
		With <code>crow run</code>, arguments are normally for <code>crow</code>, not the script it's running.
		<br />
		But after <code>--</code>, arguments are passed to the script.
		So for an <code>--aot</code> equivalent to <code>./hello.crow args here</code>, run:
		<br />
		<code>crow run hello.crow --aot -- args here</code>
	</p>

	<h3>Just print errors</h3>
	<p>
		Run <code>crow check hello.crow</code>
		to just print compile errors (and warnings) without building or running the code.
	</p>

	<h3>Compile errors don't stop the program</h3>
	<p>
		<code>crow run hello.crow</code> will usually try to run code even if there were compile errors.
		<br />
		If a compile error is reached, it throws an exception.
	</p>
	<p>
		Try running the below code (through any method except <code>crow build</code>).
		<br />
		It will run the program normally until it reaches the compile error, then throw an exception.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log "hello, world"
			call-a-function-that-does-not-exist
			info log "goodbye, world"
			()
	</crow-runnable>
