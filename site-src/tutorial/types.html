	<h2>Primitive types</h2>

	<p>The primitive types are:</p>
	<table><tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><code class="type">bool</code></td>
			<td>
				Boolean type; <code class="function">false</code> or <code class="function">true</code>.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code class="type">char8</code></td>
			<td>
				Single byte in a UTF-8 string.
				This is not a numeric type.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<code class="type">nat8</code>,
				<code class="type">nat16</code>,
				<code class="type">nat32</code>,
				<code class="type">nat64</code>
			</td>
			<td>
				Natural numbers, in the range 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1.
				<code class="type">nat</code> is short for <code class="type">nat64</code>.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<code class="type">int8</code>,
				<code class="type">int16</code>,
				<code class="type">int32</code>,
				<code class="type">int64</code>
			</td>
			<td>
				Integers, in the range -2<sup>n - 1</sup> to 2<sup>n - 1</sup> - 1.
				<code class="type">int</code> is short for <code class="type">int64</code>.
			</td>
			<tr>
				<td><code class="type">float32</code>, <code class="type">float64</code></td>
				<td>
					Floating-point values.
					<code class="type">float</code> is short for <code class="type">float64</code>.
				</td>
			</tr>
		</tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<h3>Arithmetic</h3>
	<p>
		<code class="type">nat</code> and <code class="type">int</code> arithmetic
		always returns an exactly correct result or throws an exception.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			a nat8 = 255
			_ = a + 1
	</crow-runnable>
	<p>
		<code class="type">float</code> arithmetic doesn't have such checks,
		since floats are usually expected to be inexact.
	</p>

	<aside>
		<h4>Use nats!</h4>
		<p>
			Unsigned integers are often avoided in other languages due to the risk of underflow:
			operations that would have returned a negative value would return a very large value instead.
			<br />
			In crow, this will cause an exception instead.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a variable doesn't make sense with a negative value (for example, a count of anything),
			make it a <code class="type">nat</code> instead of <code class="int">int</code>
			to protect it from negative values.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<h3>Conversion</h3>
	<p>
		There is no dedicated syntax for conversion,
		but a function should be named <code class="function">to</code> if it does an obvious conversion.
		<br />
		This relies on type inference which will be explained more in {{tutorial/type-inference}}.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			n nat = 3
			i int = n to
			f float = i to
			s string = f to
			info log s
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		As with arithmetic, conversions between nat/int types will throw if they can't return an exact result.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			i int = -3
			_ nat = i to
	</crow-runnable>

	<h2>Strings</h2>
	<p>
		Strings are technically a library type and not a primitive type.
		<br />
		<code class="type">string</code> wraps a <code class="type">char8[]</code>;
		a list of UTF-8 bytes.
		<br />
		Lists are explained more in {{tutorial/collections}}.
		What's relevant is that they are efficient to concatenate.
	</p>

	<h3>String syntax</h3>
	<p>
		Basic string syntax is very similar to C: <code>"hello"</code>.
		<br />
		They support the same escape sequences, like <code>"hello\nworld"</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are also triple-quoted strings that allow newlines in the string.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log "hello\nworld"
			info log """
I wrote a haiku
about programming in crow
but I forgot it
"""
	</crow-runnable>

	<h3>String interpolation</h3>
	<p>
		You've seen this a lot already.
		<br />
		<code>"1 + 1 is {1 + 1}!"</code> is shorthand for
		<code>("1 + 1 is ", (1 + 1).to, "!") interpolate</code>.
		<br />
		The <code>.to</code> is to convert whatever is interpolated to <code>string</code>.
	</p>

	<h3>String functions</h3>
	<p>
		Strings act like a collection, so if a function is missing from {{doc/string}},
		look for it in {{doc/col/collection}} instead.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Symbols</h2>
	<p>
		Strings are often used simply as identifiers or like ad-hoc enums.
		In crow, you should instead use <code class="type">symbol</code>s for those use cases.
		<br />
		A <code class="type">symbol</code> is a unique identifier that comes from a string.
		<br />
		The string is interned,
		meaning that two separately-allocated strings that are equal will only result in a single allocated symbol.
		<br />
		So, two symbols are equal if their pointers are equal.
		That means <code class="function">==</code> on symbols is fast, making them good as a key in a map.
	</p>
	<p>The literal syntax for a symbol is the same as for a string.</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			info log "{"left".opposite}"

		opposite symbol(a symbol)
			# This will be fast since it compares symbols by identity.
			if a == "left"
				"right"
			elif a == "right"
				"left"
			else
				"nowhere"
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		As usual, to convert between strings and symbols, call the <code class="function">to</code> function.
	</p>

	<h2>Tuples</h2>
	<p>
		You've already seen tuples in the section on destructuring in {{tutorial/local-variables}}.
		<br />
		The syntax for a tuple type is like <code>(nat, string)</code> or <code>(nat, string, float)</code>.
		It can have up to 9 members. It can't have less than 2.
	</p>
	<p>
		A tuple type is often created implicitly by a destructuring,
		as in <code>n nat, s string</code> declaring a <code>(nat, string)</code> tuple.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void()
			tuple (nat, string) = 0, "a"
			# equivalent
			n nat, s string = 0, "a"
			# '==' is defined based on the members
			info log "{tuple == (n, s)}"
	</crow-runnable>
