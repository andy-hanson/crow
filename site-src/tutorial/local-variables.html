	<h2>Using local variables</h2>
	<p>
		Defining a local variable is as simple as writing an <code class="keyword">=</code> after the name.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			x = "Hello, world!"
			info log x
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">There is no syntax to declare an uninitialized local variable.</aside>

	<h3>Adding a type annotation</h3>
	<p>
		Local variables can optionally have an explicit type.
		As usual, this is written after the name.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			x string = "Hello, world!"
			info log x
			()
	</crow-runnable>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Mutable locals</h2>
	<p>
		By default, locals are read-only.
		Use the <code class="keyword">mut</code> keyword to make it mutable.
		Then use <code class="keyword">:=</code> to change the value.
	</p>
	<p>
		The type annotation remains optional.
		If present, it should go after <code class="keyword">mut</code>.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			x mut string = "Hello, world!"
			info log x
			x := "goodbye"
			info log x
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside>
		<h4>Variable vs type mutability</h4>
		<p>
			Whether a local <em>variable</em> is mutable is unrelated to whether the <em>type</em> is mutable.
		</p>
		<ul class="bullets">
			<li>
				<code>x mut string</code> is a mutable reference to an immutable string.
				<br />
				You could change it to refer to a different string, but that wouldn't affect the original string.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>x string-builder</code> is an immutable reference to a <code>string-builder</code>
				(which is a mutable type).
				It always refers to the same <code>string-builder</code> and can't be reassigned to a different one.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>x mut string-builder</code> would be a rebindable <code>string-builder</code>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			One way to remember this is that <code class="keyword">mut</code> modifies the variable, not the type.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<h3>Short syntax for updates</h3>
	<p>
			Any function name can be placed in front of the <code class="keyword">:=</code>.
		<br />
		<code>x foo:= y</code> is shorthand for <code>x := x foo y</code>.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			x mut nat = 0
			x +:= 1
			info log "{x}"
			()
	</crow-runnable>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Destructuring</h2>
	<p>When a value is a tuple, you can declare a variable for each component of the tuple instead of for the whole.</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			tuple (string, string) = "hello", "world"
			greeting, target = tuple
			info log "Tell {target} I said {greeting}"
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		<code>(string, string)</code> is the syntax for a tuple type.
		<br />
		<code>"hello", "world"</code> creates the tuple.
	</aside>

	<h3>Ignored values</h3>
	<p>
		Use <code class="keyword">_</code> acts like a local name,
		but you can't use it to get the value of the local, marking it as intentionally unused.
		<br />
		Normally, crow requires an expression to be <code class="struct">void</code> if its value is unused,
		so <code>_ =</code> is useful to explicitly drop a value.
		<br />
		It's also useful in destructuring if you some of the members of a tuple are unused.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			# Just calling this for the side effect
			_ = func
			()
		func string()
			info log "side effect"
			"return value"
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		The syntax for a local declaration applies recursively,
		so each component of a destructuring could be mutable,
		have a type annotation, be ignored, or even be another destructuring.
	</p>
	<p>
		Parameters are local variables and support all of the same features.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			tuple (string, string) = "hello", "world"
			info log tuple.greet
			()
		
		greet string((greeting mut string, target string))
			# This mutates the local 'greeting', not the original tuple.
			greeting := "aloha"
			"Tell {target} I said {greeting}"
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		Since both halves of the destructuring had type annotations,
		there's no need for a redundant <code>(string, string)</code> type annotation for the parameter.
	</aside>
