	<h2>Futures</h2>
	<p>
		A <em>future</em> is a placeholder for a value that won't be available until later.
		<br />
		For example, the value could be computed in parallel, or the result of a network request.
		<br />
		Appending <code class="keyword">^</code> to a type wraps it in a future.
		For example, <code class="struct">nat^</code> is future type that resolves to a <code class="struct">nat</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		An example of a future is the result of <code class="fun">parallel</code>. This launches a parallel task.
		<br />
		A <em>task</em> is a piece of code that can run independently.
		The runtime is responsible for assigning tasks to threads.
		Almost all code, including the <code class="fun">main</code> function, runs as part of a task.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			fut nat^ = with : parallel
				info log "inside the task"
				()
			info log "after creating fut"
			fut
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		<p>
			If you run this from the command line, it might log "inside the task" before "after creating fut".
			<br />
			In the browser, there's only one thread, so the "parallel" task will always run after the main task.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<p>
		In this example, <code>with : parallel</code> causes the code in the block to run in a parallel task.
		<br />
		The expression <em>immediately</em> returns a <code class="struct">nat^</code>,
		likely before the parallel task has finished.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice how the <code class="fun">main</code> function doesn't return <code class="keyword">()</code>
		like all the previous examples have. Instead it returns <code class="local">fut</code>.
		The <code>()</code> on line 4 becomes the value ultimately returned by <code class="fun">main</code>.
	</p>
	
	<aside>
		<h4>Constructing a future</h4>
		<p>
			You can convert any value to a future resolved with that value using <code class="fun">new</code>.
			For example, <code>(1,)</code> is a future resolved to <code>1</code>.
			<br />
			<code>()</code> is a future resolved to <code>()</code> of its resolved type.
			For a <code class="struct">nat</code>, it's equivalent to <code>(0,)</code>.
			In the context of <code class="fun">main</code> that means the program will have an exit code of 0.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<h2>Chaining futures with "then"</h2>

	<p>
		There's no way to "block" waiting for the value inside a future.
		(Meaning, there's no conversion from <code class="struct">nat^</code> to <code class="struct">nat</code>.)
		<br />
		But you can schedule a task to run when the future resolves. That's what <code class="fun">then</code> does.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			fut string^ = with : parallel
				info log "inside fut"
				"world",
			info log "after creating fut"
			fut then x =>
				info log "hello, {x}"
				()
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside>
		As the name implies, <code class="fun">then</code> imposes an ordering:
		The lambda starting at <code>x =></code> won't be called until after <code>fut</code> resolves.
		Otherwise we wouldn't have a value for <code>x</code>.
	</aside>

	<p>
		The lambda passed to <code class="fun">then</code> is expected to return another future.
		When that future resolves,
		the future returned by <code class="fun">then</code> will also resolve with the same value.
		<br />
		To demonstrate:
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			a string^ = "hello",
			b string^ = a then x => "{x}, world",
			b then x =>
				info log x
				()
	</crow-runnable>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Task exclusion and "far" lambdas</h2>

	<p>The lambda passed to <code class="fun">then</code> can have a mutable closure.</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			xs string mut[] = ()
			f0 void^ = ("hello",) then x =>
				xs ~= x
				()
			f1 void^ = ("world",) then x =>
				xs ~= x
				()
			f0 | f1 then ((), ()) =>
				info log xs.to::string[].to::json.to
				()
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		<code>f0 | f1</code> returns a future that resolves to a tuple
		of the values returned by <code>f0</code> and <code>f1</code>.
		<br />
		In this case, those would be two <code class="struct">void</code> values, destructured by <code>((), ())</code>.
	</aside>

	<p>
		How is this possible?
		The lambda can't be an <code class="keyword">act</code>
		because a <code class="struct">future</code>, being a <code class="keyword">shared</code> type,
		can only reference <code class="keyword">shared</code> things.
		It can't be a <code class="keyword">fun</code> because it needs a mutable closure.
		<br />
		Instead, there is a third kind of lambda, <code class="keyword">far</code>.
		Though you should treat it as an opaque value,
		internally it wraps an <code class="keyword">act</code> and an <em>exclusion</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		An exclusion identifies an isolated space of mutable objects.
		Only one task with the same exclusion can run at a time.
		(You could think of it as like a lock or mutex, although it isn't implemented that way.)
	</p>
	<p>
		The benefit of a <code class="keyword">far</code> lambda
		is that it is considered <code class="keyword">shared</code>, and yet it can have mutable data in its closure.
		<br />
		Hence the name: <code class="keyword">far</code> enable communication between different mutable exclusions.
		These exclusions act like they are "far" from each other, since they communicate asynchronously.
	</p>

	<p>
		When a <code class="keyword">far</code> lambda is created,
		it gets the same exclusion as the task that created it.
		<br />
		So in the example, the three <code class="fun">then</code> lambdas
		have the same exclusion as <code class="fun">main</code>.
	</p>

	<h3>"Fun" means parallel</h3>
	<p>
		Unlike <code class="fun">then</code> which takes a <code class="keyword">far</code> lambda,
		<code>with : parallel</code> takes a <code class="keyword">fun</code>,
		indicating that it expects parallel-safe code.
		<br />
		(Recall that the body of a <code class="keyword">with</code> is really a lambda.)
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			x string mut[] = ()
			with : parallel
				x ~= "hello" # compile error
				()
	</crow-runnable>

	<h2>Arrow syntax for "then"</h2>

	<p>
		The lambda passed to <code class="fun">then</code> should return a future.
		Often this is another call to <code class="fun">then</code>.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			("hello",) then x =>
				("{x}, world",)::string^ then y =>
					info log y
					()
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		There is a syntax for using <code class="fun">then</code> without writing out the lambda.
		<br />
		<code>x &lt;- y</code> is like writing <code>y then x =></code>.
		<br />
		The previous example could be written like the below:
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			x string &lt;- "hello",
			y string &lt;- "{a}, world",
			info log "{y}"
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		Since this is equivalent to using a lambda, the parameter to the left of the <code class="keyword">&lt;-</code>
		supports destructuring.
	</p>

	<p>
		The code below the <code class="keyword">&lt;-</code> becomes the body of the lambda.
		The effect is restricted to the block it's contained in.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			if true # Compile error
				x &lt- "foo",
				info log x
				()
				# '&lt;-' expression ends here
			# This is *not* part of the '&lt;-' expression
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		The <code class="keyword">if</code> expression above has a type of <code class="struct">void^</code>
		(because its body is a call to <code class="fun">then</code>),
		so we need another <code class="keyword">&lt;-</code> to wait on it.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			&lt;- if true
				x &lt- "foo",
				info log x
				()
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		Having nothing to the left of <code class="keyword">&lt;-</code> is like having
		<code class="keyword">()</code> as a lambda parameter;
		it's a destructuring expecting <code class="struct">void</code>.
		<br />
		Also note the implicit <code>else ()</code> which produces a future resolved to a void value.
	</aside>

<section>
	<h2>Futures and exceptions</h2>

	<p>
		When an exception is thrown in code that would have resolved a future,
		the future is instead <em>rejected</em>.
		<br />
		Calling <code class="fun">then</code> on a rejected future results in another rejected future.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			xs string[] = "hello",
			fut string^ = with : parallel
				xs[1],
			info log "this is reached"
			x &lt;- fut
			info log "{x} is not reached"
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		The exception in the lambda doesn't affect other tasks directly, but causes the
		lambda passed to <code class="fun">then</code> to never be called.
		<br />
		To handle the exception, there is <code class="fun">future-catch</code>.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			xs string[] = "hello",
			fut string^ = with : parallel
				xs[1],
			fut-caught (string, exception) result^ = fut future-catch
			x <- fut-caught
			match x
			as ok v
				info log "ok: {v}"
				()
			as error e
				error log trusted "err: {e}"
				1,
	</crow-runnable>
