	<h2>Futures</h2>
	<p>
		A <em>future</em> is a placeholder for a value that won't be available until later.
		<br />
		For example, the value could be computed in parallel, or the result of a network request.
		<br />
		Appending <code class="keyword">^</code> to a type wraps it in a future.
		For example, <code class="type">nat^</code> is future type that resolves to a <code class="type">nat</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		An example of a future is the result of <code class="function">parallel</code>. This launches a parallel task.
		<br />
		A <em>task</em> is a piece of code that can run independently.
		The runtime is responsible for assigning tasks to threads.
		Almost all code, including the <code class="function">main</code> function, runs as part of a task.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			fut nat^ = with : parallel
				info log "inside the task"
				()
			info log "after creating fut"
			fut
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside>
		<h4>The browser is not parallel</h4>
		<p>
			If you run this from the command line, it might log "inside the task" before "after creating fut".
			<br />
			In the browser, there's only one thread, so the "parallel" task will always run after the main task.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<p>
		In this example, <code>with : parallel</code> causes the code in the block to run in a parallel task.
		<br />
		The expression <em>immediately</em> returns a <code class="type">nat^</code>,
		likely before the parallel task has finished.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now we see the <code class="function">main</code> signature that most real programs will use.
		It returns a <code class="type">nat^</code> future for the program's exit code,
		and takes command-line arguments in a <code class="type">string[]</code>.
		<br />
		When <code class="function">main</code> returns <code class="local">fut</code>,
		the program waits for it to resolve instead of exiting immediately.
		The <code>()</code> on line 4 becomes the value ultimately returned by <code class="function">main</code>.
	</p>

	<aside>
		<h4>Constructing a future</h4>
		<p>
			You can convert any value to a future resolved with that value using <code class="function">new</code>.
			For example, <code>(1,)</code> is a future resolved to <code>1</code>.
			<br />
			<code>()</code> is a future resolved to <code>()</code> of its resolved type.
			For a <code class="type">nat</code>, it's equivalent to <code>(0,)</code>.
			In the context of <code class="function">main</code>, that means the program will have an exit code of 0.
		</p>
	</aside>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Chaining futures with "then"</h2>

	<p>
		There's no way to "block" waiting for the value inside a future.
		(Meaning, there's no conversion function from <code class="type">nat^</code> to <code class="type">nat</code>.)
		<br />
		But you can schedule a task to run when the future resolves.
		That's what <code class="function">then</code> does.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			fut string^ = with : parallel
				info log "inside fut"
				"world",
			info log "after creating fut"
			fut then x =>
				info log "hello, {x}"
				()
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside>
		As the name implies, <code class="function">then</code> imposes an ordering:
		The lambda starting at <code>x =></code> won't be called until after <code>fut</code> resolves.
		Otherwise we wouldn't have a value for <code>x</code>.
	</aside>

	<p>
		The lambda passed to <code class="function">then</code> is expected to return another future.
		When that future resolves,
		the future returned by <code class="function">then</code> will also resolve with the same value.
		<br />
		To demonstrate:
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			a string^ = "hello",
			b string^ = a then x => "{x}, world",
			b then x =>
				info log x
				()
	</crow-runnable>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Task exclusion</h2>

	<p>The lambda passed to <code class="function">then</code> can have a mutable closure.</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			xs string mut[] = ()
			f0 void^ = ("hello",)::string^ then x =>
				xs ~= x
				()
			f1 void^ = ("world",)::string^ then x =>
				xs ~= x
				()
			f0 | f1 then ((), ()) =>
				info log xs.to::json.to
				()
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		<code>f0 | f1</code> returns a future that resolves to a tuple
		of the values returned by <code>f0</code> and <code>f1</code>.
		<br />
		In this case, those would be two <code class="type">void</code> values, destructured by <code>((), ())</code>.
	</aside>

	<p>
		This is allowed because <code class="function">then</code> takes a <code class="keyword">mut</code> lambda.
		But <code class="function">then</code> needs to attach it to the future, which is a
		<code class="keyword">shared</code> type and can only reference other
		<code class="keyword">shared</code> values.
	</p>
	<p>
		To make this work, the runtime tags the <code class="keyword">mut</code> lambda with an <em>exclusion</em>.
		An exclusion is a (non-observable) number that identifies an isolated space of mutable objects.
		If two tasks have the same exclusion, only one of them can run at a time.
		You could think of an exclusion as like a lock or mutex, although it isn't implemented that way.
	</p>
	<p>
		The exclusion comes from the currently running task. <br />
		All the tasks created in the above example have the same exclusion,
		and if they created their own tasks, those would have the same exclusion too.
		Generally, the same exclusion will propagate unless you explicitly use a function with a name like
		<code class="function">parallel</code>.
		<br />
		That means you don't get parallel execution until you ask for it.
	</p>

	<h3>Parallel functions take "shared" lambdas</h3>
	<p>
		Unlike <code class="function">then</code> which takes a <code class="keyword">mut</code> lambda,
		<code>with : parallel</code> takes a <code>t^ shared()</code> in order to run it in parallel.
		<br />
		(Recall that the body of a <code class="keyword">with</code> is really a lambda.)
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			parts string mut[] = ()
			with : parallel
				parts ~= "hello" # compile error
				()
	</crow-runnable>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Share any lambda</h2>
	<p>
		You can use the <code class="keyword">shared</code> keyword to make any lambda shared,
		even if it has a <code class="keyword">mut</code> closure.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			parts string mut[] = ()
			f void^ shared(x string) = shared x =>
				parts ~= x
				()
			res void^ = for x : ("hello", "world")::string[] parallel
				f[x]
			res then () =>
				info log (", " join parts.to)
				()
	</crow-runnable>
	<p>
		This works by giving the lambda an exclusion, so it will only run once at a time.
		<br />
		That means the above example is not really running in parallel since there is only one call to
		<code class="function">f</code> at a time.
		<br />
		However, they could happen in any order, so, it is possible that it might log "world, hello".
		(This won't happen in the browser which is single-threaded.)
	</p>

<section>
	<h2>Arrow syntax for "then"</h2>

	<p>
		The lambda passed to <code class="function">then</code> should return a future.
		Often this is another call to <code class="function">then</code>.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			("hello",)::string^ then x =>
				("{x}, world",)::string^ then y =>
					info log y
					()
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		There is a syntax for using <code class="function">then</code> without writing out the lambda.
		<br />
		<code>x &lt;- y</code> is like writing <code>y then x =></code>.
		<br />
		The above example could instead be written like the below:
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			x string &lt;- "hello",
			y string &lt;- "{x}, world",
			info log "{y}"
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		Since this is equivalent to using a lambda, the parameter to the left of the <code class="keyword">&lt;-</code>
		supports destructuring.
	</p>

	<p>
		The code below the <code class="keyword">&lt;-</code> becomes the body of the lambda.
		The effect is restricted to the block it's contained in.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			if true
				x &lt- ("foo",)::string^ # compile error
				info log x
				()
				# '&lt;-' expression ends here
			# This is *not* part of the '&lt;-' expression
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		The <code class="keyword">if</code> expression above is still expected to be <code class="type">void</code>
		because it appears on its own line.
		We need to use <code class="keyword">&lt;- if</code> so that the <code class="keyword">if</code>
		can be a <code class="type">void^</code>.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			&lt;- if true
				x &lt- ("foo",)::string^
				info log x
				()
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		Having nothing to the left of <code class="keyword">&lt;-</code> is like having
		<code class="keyword">()</code> as a lambda parameter;
		it's a destructure expecting <code class="type">void</code>.
		<br />
		Also note the implicit <code>else ()</code> which produces a future resolved to a void value.
	</aside>

	<h2>Futures and exceptions</h2>

	<p>
		When an exception is thrown in code that would have resolved a future,
		the future is instead <em>rejected</em>.
		<br />
		Calling <code class="function">then</code> on a rejected future results in another rejected future.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			xs string[] = "hello",
			fut string^ = with : parallel
				xs[1],
			info log "this is reached"
			x &lt;- fut
			info log "{x} is not reached"
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		The exception in the lambda doesn't affect other tasks directly, but causes the
		lambda passed to <code class="function">then</code> to never be called.
		<br />
		To handle the exception, there is <code class="function">future-catch</code>.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[])
			xs string[] = "hello",
			fut string^ = with : parallel
				xs[1],
			fut-caught (string, exception) result^ = fut future-catch
			x &lt;- fut-caught
			match x
			as ok v
				info log "It went well: {v}"
				()
			as error e
				error log trusted "Something came up: {e}"
				1,
	</crow-runnable>
