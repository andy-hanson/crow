	<h2>"Summon" functions</h2>

	<p>
		In most programming languages, all functions can do I/O.
		(Meaning, nothing about the function signature tells you whether it does I/O.)
		<br />
		In crow, ordinary functions can't initiate I/O.
		Functions that do so must be marked <code class="keyword">summon</code>.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		import
			crow/io/print: out, print

		main void() summon
			out print "Hello, world!"
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		Imports will be explained in {{tutorial/modules}}.
		Basically, this makes the functions <code class="function">out</code> and
		<code class="function">print</code> visible.
	</aside>

	<p>
		<code class="function">print</code> is a <code class="keyword">summon</code> function.
		It can only be directly called by another <code class="keyword">summon</code> function,
		which is why we marked <code class="function">main</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		A function not marked <code class="keyword">summon</code> can still call lambdas
		which do come from a <code class="keyword">summon</code> function.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		import
			crow/io/print: out, print

		main void() summon
			3 times () =>
				out print "This is I/O"

		# not 'summon'
		times void(n nat, f void mut())
			for _ : 0::nat .. n
				# but does call into code from a 'summon' function
				f[]
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		In the above example, <code class="function">times</code> is an ordinary function.
		Yet, running it causes I/O to happen due to calling <code class="local">f</code>.
		<br />
		Still, <code class="function">times</code> is considered ordinary because its I/O
		is fully controlled by its caller.
	</p>

	<p>
		It's called <code class="keyword">summon</code> because
		it allows a function to "summon" new I/O capabilities <em>ex nihilo</em>,
		as opposed to receiving them as lambdas through parameters.
	</p>
	<p>
		If an ordinary function can't reach any lambdas through its parameters,
		it can't perform any I/O (except <code class="function">log</code>).
	</p>

	<aside>
		<h4>"Data" and I/O</h4>
		<p>
			A <code class="keyword">data</code> lambda can't do any I/O,
			even if it's in a <code class="keyword">summon</code> function.
			This ensures that if a type is <code class="keyword">data</code>,
			no kind of side effect can happen through it.
			<br />
			Try changing <code>f void mut()</code> above to <code>f void data()</code> to see the compile error.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<h2>Interfaces</h2>
	<p>
		Crow has no "interface" keyword, but it does have a pattern that accomplishes that.
		<br />
		In case passing a separate lambda for each possible I/O action is excessive,
		they can be joined together in a record.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		import
			crow/io/print: out, print

		main nat(_ string[]) summon
			make-connection use-connection
			()

		connection record shared
			read string? shared(key symbol)
			write void shared(key symbol, value string)

		make-connection connection() summon
			db string mut[symbol] = ()
			read: shared key =>
				out print "read {key}"
				db[key]
			write: shared (key, value) =>
				out print "write to {key}: {value}"
				db[key] := value
				()

		use-connection void(a connection)
			a write "key", "value"
			info log "value is {a read "key" ?? "not found"}"
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		This uses the "named new" syntax described in {{tutorial/special-call-syntax#named-new}}.
		<br />
		It also uses "callers" for <code class="function">read</code> and <code class="function">write</code>
		described in {{tutorial/lambdas#callers}}.
	</aside>

	<p>
		In the above example, <code class="type">connection</code> is the "interface":
		a record full of <code class="keyword">far</code> lambdas.
		<br />
		It allows <code class="function">use-connection</code> to be written without
		<code class="keyword">summon</code>.
		<br />
		Ideally, a small amount of code should be <code class="keyword">summon</code>
		and the rest should use interfaces.
	</p>
	<p>
		Observe that in this example we're using a map to fake most of the I/O.
		<br />
		Since normal functions can only do I/O through their parameters,
		you can make them into pure functions by passing parameters that do nothing (or fake I/O).
		<br />
		This is useful for tests.
	</p>

	<h2>Overriding 'log'</h2>

	<p>
		Logging is always allowed, but you can temporarily change the log handler when calling a function.
		<br />
		Currently this can only be done for native code, as JS logging always uses the JS console.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main void() native extern
			with : (_ => ()) temp-log-handler
				info log "this won't be logged"
			info log "done"
	</crow-runnable>
