	<h2>"Summon" functions</h2>

	<p>
		In most programming languages, all functions can do I/O.
		(Meaning, nothing about the function signature tells you whether it does I/O.)
		<br />
		In crow, ordinary functions can't initiate I/O.
		Functions that do so must be marked <code class="spec">summon</code>.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		import
			crow/io/print: out, print

		main nat^(_ string[]) summon
			out print "Hello, world!"
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		Imports will be explained in {{tutorial/modules}}.
		Basically, this makes the functions <code class="fun">out</code> and <code class="fun">print</code> visible.
	</aside>

	<p>
		<code class="fun">print</code> is a <code class="spec">summon</code> function.
		It can only be directly called by another <code class="spec">summon</code> function,
		which is why we marked <code class="fun">main</code>.
		<br />
		See the compile error if you remove <code class="spec">summon</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		A function not marked <code class="spec">summon</code> can't initiate I/O,
		but this isn't as simple as such functions being pure.
		They can call lambda parameters which do come from a <code class="spec">summon</code> function.
	</p>

	<crow-runnable>
		import
			crow/io/print: out, print

		main nat^(_ string[]) summon
			3 times () =>
				out print "This is I/O"
			()

		times void(n nat, f act void())
			for _ : 0 .. n
				f[]
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		In the above example, <code class="fun">times</code> is an ordinary function.
		Yet, running it causes I/O to happen due to calling <code class="local">f</code>.
		<br />
		Still, <code class="fun">times</code> is considered ordinary because its I/O
		is fully controlled by its caller.
	</p>

	<p>
		It's called <code class="spec">summon</code> because
		it allows a function to "summon" new I/O capacilities <em>ex nihilo</em>,
		as opposed to receiving them as lambdas through parameters.
	</p>

	<aside class="small">
		If an ordinary function can't reach any lambdas through its parameters,
		it can't perform any I/O (except <code class="fun">log</code>).
	</aside>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Interfaces</h2>
	<p>
		Crow has no "interface" keyword, but it does have a pattern that accomplishes that.
		<br />
		In real code, passing a separate lambda for each possible I/O action is impractical.
		Instead, they can be joined together in a record.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		import
			crow/io/print: out, print

		main nat^(_ string[]) summon
			connection = make-connection
			&lt;- connection use-connection
			()

		connection record shared
			write far void(symbol, string)
			read far string?(symbol)

		make-connection connection() summon
			db string mut[symbol] = ()
			write far void(symbol, string) = (key, value) =>
				out print "write to {key}: {value}"
				db[key] := value
				()
			read far string?(symbol) = key =>
				out print "read {key}"
				db[key],
			write, read

		use-connection void^(a connection)
			&lt;- a.write["key", "value"]
			value &lt;- a.read["key"]
			info log "value is {value ?? "not found"}"
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<aside class="small">
		Even though the function is declared as <code>far void(symbol, string)</code>,
		the lambda should actually return a <code>void^</code>.
		<br />
		All <code class="keyword">far</code> functions return futures,
		so the <code>^</code> is omitted when writing the type.
	</aside>

	<p>
		In the above example, <code class="struct">connection</code> is the "interface":
		a record full of <code class="keyword">far</code> lambdas.
		<br />
		It allows <code class="fun">use-connection</code> to be written without <code class="spec">summon</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Observe that in this example we're using a map to fake most of the I/O.
		<br />
		Since normal functions can only do I/O through their parameters,
		you can make them into pure functions by passing parameters that do nothing (or fake I/O).
		<br />
		This is useful for tests, and means that all normal functions in crow are testable.
	</p>

	<p>
		You won't see a lot of interfaces in the standard library,
		which usually just defines I/O actions directly.
		<br />
		This is because it's hard for a standard library to choose interfaces that work for everyone,
		so it's better that you choose interfaces yourself that exactly fit your situation.
	</p>

	<h2>Overriding 'log'</h2>

	<p>
		For practicality, logging is allowed in all normal functions.
		<br />
		However, you can temporarily change the log handler when calling a function.
	</p>
	<crow-runnable>
		main nat^(_ string[]) summon
			with : (_ => ()) temp-log-handler
				info log "this won't be logged"
			info log "done"
			()
	</crow-runnable>

	<p>
		In this example we simply ignored the log to turn off logging.
		<br />
		For details, see {{doc/log}}.
