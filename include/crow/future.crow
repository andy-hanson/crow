###
A future already resolved to void.
Writing `<- delay` will cause the code below to run in a new task.
This can be useful for breaking up big tasks.

`delay` from `crow/io/time` is useful for delaying for linger times.
###
delay void^()
	()

# Converts a value to a future resolved with that value.
new<a> a^(value a) trusted
	res a^ = uninit, value.resolved
	res.lock init
	res

# Future resolved to `()`.
new<a> a^() new<a>
	(),

# Future resolved with an exception.
rejected<a> a^(err exception) trusted
	res a^ = uninit, err.rejected
	res.lock init
	res

# TODO: is-sendable<list a> should not be necessary
###
Waits for every one of `futures` to be resolved, then returns an array all of their results.

If one of `futures` resolves with an exception, this resolves to the leftmost exception (discarding others),
regardless of which exception happened first.

Use `wait-fold` instead of you intend to iterate over the result anyway.
###
wait-all<a> a[]^(futures a^[]) trusted is-sendable<a> is-sendable<a[]>
	<- futures wait-all-complete
	(for x : futures; x.get-result ok-or-throw),

###
Waits on each of `futures` in turn, calling `f` to get a new accumulator.
###
wait-fold<a, b> a^(acc a, futures b^[], f ref a(a, b)) is-sendable<a> is-sendable<b>
	if futures is-empty
		acc,
	else
		cur <- futures[0]
		new-acc <- f[acc, cur]
		new-acc wait-fold futures.tail, f

# Returns a future that is resolved once all inputs are resolved.

	task task = cur-exclusion, () =>
		*count := *count - 1
		if *count == 0
			res resolve ()
	for x : futures
		x add-task task
	res

###
Future resolved to `ok` if `a` succeeds and `err` if `a` fails with an exception.
###
future-catch<a> result<a, exception>^(a a^) trusted is-sendable<a>
	res result<a, exception>^ = unresolved

				as ok _
					res resolve value
				as err e
					res reject e
			as err e
				res reject e
	res

###
Calls `f` once `a` is resolved.
Returns a future for the result of `f`.

If `a` is resolved with an exception, this never calls `f`,
and the result of `then` will have the same exception as `a`.
###
then<out, in> out^(a in^, f ref out(in)) trusted is-sendable<out> is-sendable<in>

			res reject e
	res

# TODO: rename to just 'then'
# This requires that we be able to handle two expected types at once,
# and choose just one based on the arity of a lambda.

# Like `then`, but `f` takes no parameter (since it will be `void` anyway.)
then-void<out> out^(a void^, f ref out()) is-sendable<out>
	a then _ =>
		f[]

launch record
launch launch()
	()
###
Run `f` in a task with a new exclusion and return a future for its result.

`f` must be a `fun` and not an `act` so that it can have a new exclusion,
which allows it to run in parallel.
###
do<a> a^(_ launch, f fun a^()) trusted
	res a^ = unresolved
	gctx = get-global-ctx
	gctx add-task gctx.new-exclusion, () =>
		match (() => f[]) catch
		as ok fut
			res forward-to fut
		as err e
			res reject e
	res

###
Calls a `ref`.

This enqueues a task with the ref's exclusion for invoking its function,
and returns a future for the result of that task.
###

	res r^ = unresolved
	action = f action
	get-global-ctx add-task f.exclusion, () =>
		match action catch
		as ok fut
			res forward-to fut
		as err e
			res reject e
	res

# Calls a `ref` with one argument.
subscript<r, p0> r^(f ref r(p0), p0 p0) trusted is-sendable<r> is-sendable<p0>
	res r^ = unresolved
	get-global-ctx add-task f.exclusion, () =>
		(() => res forward-to f.action[p0]) catch err => res reject err
	res

# Calls a `ref` with two arguments.

	f ref r(p0, p1),
	p0 p0,

	res r^ = unresolved
	get-global-ctx add-task f.exclusion, () =>
		(() => res forward-to f.action[p0, p1]) catch err => res reject err
	res

###
If the future resolves successfully, does nothing.
Else, this will call the default exception handler.
