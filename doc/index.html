			<h2>Noze</h2>

			<p>Noze is a new programming language. Some interesting features are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Safe: Noze functions can't access anything that wasn't passed in as a parameter.
						That means no global state, and no unsafe memory operations.
						They also can't perform I/O without permission being passed in by a parameter.
						This means that if you're tracking down a bug, you can exclude a function (and all code in it)
						based on just the arguments passed.
						Unsafe code (such as calling C libraries) is possible
						but can't be accidentally called from safe code.
					</p>
					<p>
						A strong notion of <code>data</code>;
						immutable, serializable types that are just "plain old data".
					</p>
					<p>The compiler allows <code>data</code> to be accessed in parallel
						(as well as some special types like <code class="struct-ref">fut</code>), but not mutable types.
					</p>
					<p>
						This allows for a <code>launch</code> function that launches a new parallel task
						and is guaranteed to only access things that are thread-safe.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Templates; everything is a template.</p>
					<p>
						Templates are checked abstractly,
						meaning you get errors at the definition instead of at use.
					</p>
					<p>
						A <code>spec</code> allows a template to refer to functions
						that it doesn't have in scope but the caller does.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Hello World!</h2>

			<p>Here is a basic program that prints <code class="lit-str">"Hello, world!"</code>:</p>

			<noze-runnable src="hello-world"></noze-runnable>

			This shows a few basic features of noze:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Modules: The main module imports types and functions from <code class="import">io</code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					A function: <code class="fun-def">main</code>.
					The name of a declaration always goes first.
					So you'll have <code class="struct-def">r record</code>,
					<code class="struct-def">u union</code>, and here,
					<code><span class="fun-def">main</span> <span class="struct-ref">fut exit-code</span></code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Templates: <code class="struct-ref">fut</code> and <code class="struct-ref">arr</code>
					are templated types, and <code class="fun-ref">resolved</code> is a templated function.
					The type arguments to <code class="fun-ref">resolved</code> are inferred
					from the return type of <code class="fun-def">main</code>).
				</li>
				<li>
					IO: The main function is labelled <code>summon</code> because it calls
					<code class="fun-ref">print</code> which is also <code>summon</code>.
					As we'll see, most code will actually not do I/O this way.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Types</h2>
			Here is a <strong>complete</strong> list of every type (or kind of type). We'll go into more detail later.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<code class="keyword">record</code>: Stores several named values.
				</li>
				<li>
					<code class="keyword">union</code>: Stores one of several other types.
					These are <em>discriminated</em> unions, meaning it knows which of the possibilities it has.
				</li>
				<li>
					<code class="struct-ref">fun, fun-mut, fun-ref</code>:
					Known as closures or lambdas in other languages.
				</li>
				<li>
					<code class="struct-ref">nat</code>,
					<code class="struct-ref">nat32</code>,
					<code class="struct-ref">nat16</code>,
					<code class="struct-ref">nat8</code>,
					<code class="struct-ref">int</code>,
					<code class="struct-ref">int32</code>,
					<code class="struct-ref">int16</code>,
					<code class="struct-ref">int8</code>: Natural numbers and integers.
				<li><code class="struct-ref">float</code> and <code class="struct-ref">float32</code></li>
				<li>
					<code class="struct-ref">bool</code>,
					<code class="struct-ref">char</code>, and
					<code class="struct-ref">void</code>
				</li>
				<li><code class="struct-ref">ptr</code>: C-style pointer for low level code</li>
				<li>
					<code class="keyword">extern-ptr</code> and <code class="struct-ref">fun-ptr</code>
					for C compatibility.
				</li>
			</ul>
